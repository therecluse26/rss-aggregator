<p>Pinetek Networks&#8217; IOL HAT is a Raspberry Pi expansion board using the IO-Link (IEC 61131-9) protocol to interact with industrial sensors. It&#8217;s based on the Analog Devices MAX14819 IO-Link master transceiver and offers two SDCI (&#8220;Single-Drop Digital Communication&#8221;) connectors. While work on the IO-Link communication protocol started in 2006, and the IEC 61131-9 &#8220;Single-drop digital communication interface (SDCI) for small sensors and actuators&#8221; standard was adopted in 2013, it only recently came onto our radar with products like the STMicro EVLIOL4LSV1 IO-Link actuator board and Renesas CCE4511 IO-Link master and ZSSC3286 IO-Link sensor signal conditioner. The IOL HAT brings the IO-Link standard for industrial IoT communication to the Raspberry Pi. IOL HAT specifications: IO-Link chip &#8211; Analog Devices MAX14819 dual IO-Link master transceiver with integrated framers and L+ supply controllers 2x SDCI ports for IEC 61131-9 (IO-Link) sensors and actuators Host connection (one or the other) PT-1201 model &#8211; 40-pin [...]</p>

<p>There are plenty of small ESP32-C3 IoT boards with a USB-C connector on the market, and while they all look very similar, antenna designs differ, and less thought-out ones may severely impact the WiFi and Bluetooth range. Peter Neufeld decided to hack one of those cheap ESP32-C3 boards by adding a custom antenna, and this resulted in the board having more than twice the range and almost three times in some cases. Those tiny boards are cramped, so there&#8217;s very little space around the ceramic antenna typically used, leading to poor RF performance. To work around that issue, Peter added a 31mm long antenna made of silver-plated wire, making a loop of about 8mm in diameter outside of the board and soldered on the ceramic antenna&#8217;s solder joints, and the rest of the wire (about 15mm) points upwards.

<p>Samsung has unveiled a 32-inch color e-paper display with WQHD (2,560 x 1,440) resolution and a built-in 4,600mAh battery that can last up to 200 days on a charge if the display is updated once a day. The Samsung 32&#8243; EMDX color e-paper display is mainly designed for digital signage applications in shops, restaurants, public transportation, and public spaces. Like other e-paper displays, it does not consume any power if the image is unchanged. I was initially surprised at the bright colors of the EMDX display from the photos shared by Samsung, but after a closer look, I&#8217;m not convinced those are photos of the actual display. Samsung 32&#8243; EMDX color e-paper display specifications: 32-inch E-Ink Spectra 6 Color ePaper with 2,544 x 1,400 resolution, up to 54,600 colors with dithering, 178° H/V viewing angle Storage &#8211; 8 GB eMMC flash Wireless &#8211; WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 Ethernet &#8211; [...]</p>

<p>Most people have heard about quantum computers, but quantum sensors? I&#8217;ve just come across those as Bosch is developing magnetic-field quantum sensors harnessing &#8220;the power of quantum physics to enable measurements with unmatched precision&#8221; while being much more compact than other quantum sensors using techniques like SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference device), vapor cells, or optical traps. Bosch Quantum Sensing (that&#8217;s the full company name) further explains its magnetic-field quantum sensors surpass the capabilities of conventional sensors by offering a wider measurement range, higher sensitivity, and higher spatial resolution. They currently have an internal quantum sensor prototype/evaluation board that&#8217;s about the size of a smartphone, so they are still quite larger than traditional sensors. Bosch quantum magnetometer can measure tiny magnetic field variations with accuracy, including the Earth magnetic&#8217;s field, and even analyze the direction of and magnetude of magnetic fields giving the equivalent of a 3D-point magnetic representation. This notably [...]</p>

<p>Aerium System&#8217;s Lumen is a carrier board for NVIDIA Jetson SO-DIMM modules designed specifically for drones and robots with a range of low-profile connectors for I/Os for USB, UART, I2C, etc&#8230;, and three M.2 sockets for storage and wireless expansion. It targets the same applications as ARK Electronics&#8217; NDAA-compliant Jetson Orin Nano/NX carrier board for drones we covered last year, but it&#8217;s not sold as a full kit and lacks NDAA-compliance. On the positive side, it is quite smaller and lighter, so it might be better suited to smaller and/or less complex drones or robots that may still benefit from Vision AI acceleration.

<p>STMicroelectronics STM32MP23 is a dual-core Cortex-A35 general-purpose microprocessor (MPU) with a Cortex-M33 real-time core, and 600 GOPS of performance operating at up to 125°C and designed for industrial and Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge computing, advanced HMI, and machine-learning (ML) applications. It follows the STM32MP25 series unveiled in 2023 and launched the following year as the first member of the STM32MP2 family. The STM32MP23 is a cost-down version of the STM32MP25 with similar specifications (and pin-to-pin compatible packages), but the new family has a weaker 0.6 TOPS NPU, and tops at two Ethernet ports for the high-end parts instead of three. Ditto for CAN Bus interfaces (2x vs 3x). Other changes include a 16-bit memory interface and the lack of PCIe and USB 3.0 interfaces.

<p>Defined by the Shenzhen 8K UHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance (SUCA), GPMI (General Purpose Media Interface) is an alternative to HDMI and DisplayPort supporting up to 192 Gbps bandwidth and 480W power delivery (PD). As far as I know, the specifications have not been made public just yet, but ITHome.com shared some photos and details. The GPMI standard defines two types of connectors: Type-B and Type-C (USB-C) with support for 192 Gbps/480W PD and 96 Gbps/240W PD, respectively. Here&#8217;s how GPMI compares to the latest HDMI and DP versions. The best resource I&#8217;ve found about the GPMI standard is a white paper shared by Hisilicon.

<p>Twotrees has sent us a TTC6050 CNC router for review, along with a vacuum cleaner Monster (M1) kit and an 800W spindle upgrade with a speed of 30,000 RPM. The machine is designed for carving and milling various materials such as wood, plastic, and metal. It features a working area of 600 x 500 x 100 mm and comes equipped with a 500W spindle by default, upgradable to an 800W spindle. It&#8217;s capable of handling larger workpieces, works faster, and supports a broader variety of materials than the TwoTrees TTC 450 CNC router we reviewed in 2023 with a 500W spindle. In this review, we will start by listing the specifications and going through an unboxing, before assembling the TTC6050 CNC router and the vacuum cleaner Monster (M1) Kit, and installing the Candle CNC software to conduct milling tests on thick MDF wood. After that, we&#8217;ll install the 800W high-speed [...]</p>

<p>IFTTT and Zapier automation tools enable users to create automated workflows connecting various apps, services, and devices. They are relatively easy to use, but their free tiers are now rather limited, and you have to rely on the cloud. Huginn is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to IFTTT or Zapier that can work on your own network without cloud connectivity. Andrew Cantino released the first version of the project 12 years ago (in 2013) by Andrew Cantino, but it now has a larger community of developers and users. Somehow, I only found out about Huginn when XDA Developers wrote about it earlier this week. Let&#8217;s have a look. Developers describe Huginn as a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online, and view it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier hosted on the user&#8217;s server with full control over the data. Here are some of the [...]</p>

<p>Firefly&#8217;s PocketCloud is a battery-powered, portable NAS powered by a Rockchip RK3568B2 quad-core Arm Cortex-A55 SoC with 4GB LPDDR5 of RAM and a 32GB eMMC flash for the OS, and supports up to 16TB of NVMe SSD storage. It&#8217;s comprised of the battery-powered PocketCloud itself with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, and an optional dock with 2.5GbE networking and an additional M.2 NVMe socket.

<p>Smart Power plugs help users monitor their appliances&#8217; power consumption, and they&#8217;d usually check measurements in a mobile app or a web dashboard. Naveen was not satisfied with this workflow while using a TP-link Kasa EP25 Smart Plug to monitor his LLM workstation&#8217;s power consumption. So he wrote the WattWise command-line interface (CLI) for power monitoring smart plugs to allow him to throttle his power-hungry, dual AMD Ryzen EPYC 7C13 workstation following his utility&#8217;s Time of Use (ToU) pricing in order to lower his electric bill. The Python tool pulls power usage data from smart plugs directly or through Home Assistant and presents it in a neat terminal-based UI. Key features: Real-time power monitoring with wattage and current display Color-coded power values (green &#60; 300W, yellow 300-1200W, red &#62; 1200W) Historical consumption charts directly in the terminal Automatic CPU/GPU throttling based on time-of-use electricity pricing Configurable power thresholds and performance [...]</p>

<p>LILYGO T-Deck Pro is a LoRa messenger based on an ESP32-S3 WiFi 4 and Bluetooth 5.x SoC, and offered with a 3.1-inch e-paper display with touchscreen, a Blackberry-like QWERTY keyboard, a GPS module, speaker, microphone, and a 3.5mm audio, as well as IMU and light sensors. It builds upon the T-Deck Plus design, but replacing the 2.8-inch IPS display with a 3.1-inch e-paper display allows for a slimmer design and should offer longer battery life despite the smaller 1,400 mAh battery used in the new model. Two versions of the T-Deck Pro are available: one with a Simcom 4G LTE modem and a cheaper one with a PCM5102A audio codec. LILYGO T-Deck Pro specifications: SoC –  ESP32-S3FN16R8 CPU &#8211; Dual-core Tensilica LX7 microcontroller @ up to 240 MHz 2.4 GHz 802.11n WiFi 4 and Bluetooth 5.0 LE connectivity Memory – 8MB PSRAM Storage – 16MB SPI flash Storage – MicroSD card [...]</p>

Waveshare has now released a V2 version of this display with a new and improved NFC chip, a &#8220;fast flashing method&#8221;, and enhanced contrast. The new batteryless, 7.5-inch NFC-powered e-paper display features an 800&#215;480 resolution and updates via an NFC-enabled smartphone or reader. It offers a 170° viewing angle and comes in a durable ABS plastic shell. The ST25R3911B NFC board allows updates via USB, SD card, or serial port, with an optional password lock. However, precise NFC positioning is required for updates. These features make it ideal for shelf labels, equipment tags, and other applications.

<p>Patrick Yang, CTO at WCH, has recently unveiled the CH570 RISC-V SoC with 2.4GHz wireless and USB 2.0 (host &#38; device) as an upgrade to the popular CH32V003 general-purpose RISC-V MCU with more features at the same low price (10 cents). CH570 also comes with 12KB SRAM and 256KB flash (vs 2KB SRAM and 16KB flash for the CH32V003), offers up to twelve GPIO,  six PWM, I2C, UART, SPI, and a 20-channel key detection module. There&#8217;s also the CH572 with the same features, except it also supports Bluetooth LE 5.0. As a side note, I wrote about the CH572 RISC-V MCU with BLE in 2019, but I guess it was scrapped likely because it had OTP instead of flash&#8230;, and the new CH572 (2025) is different.

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest post by Avishay Shraga, Sr. Director (CTO), Head of Security Technologies at Sony Semiconductor Israel, discussing IoT security as quantum computing draws near. The key to modern asymmetric cryptography is to create an equation that is easy to solve in one direction but difficult to reverse by an adversary in the other direction. Traditionally, this was done through modular arithmetic, where a large prime modulus and a generator were used to generate a key, although there are multiple methods to do so. The strength of this one-way function is measured by the time and computing power needed to reverse it. ECC 256, considered by many to be one of the gold standards in modern cryptography, would take millions of years to crack using current computing and capabilities.

<p>Espressif released the ESP ZeroCode web application in the summer of 2023 to create custom Matter-certifiable firmware for ESP32 targets. However, if your application requires some more customization, but you don&#8217;t have the budget or need for a software engineering team, the company has now launched ESP LowCode Matter. It retains most of the simplicity of ESP ZeroCode, but also provides the ability to further customize the application without having to use the ESP Matter SDK, which requires more advanced coding skills to build your own firmware. The ESP LowCode Matter divides firmware into two components to simplify the development, maintenance, and certification process: System Firmware &#8211; Managed by Espressif, handling the Matter protocol, wireless stacks, OTA updates, and security management. Application Firmware &#8211; Developed by device makers, focusing on hardware interfacing, event and state indication, and user interaction. Development is done right in the web browser thanks to VS [...]</p>

<p>SparkFun&#8217;s &#8220;Air Quality PM1/PM2.5/PM10 Sensor &#8211; BMV080 (Qwiic)&#8221; is breakout board for the Bosch Sensortec BMV080 particulate matter sensor which the German company claims is the world&#8217;s smallest and 450 times smaller in volume than any comparable device on the market. It&#8217;s summer in Thailand right now, and besides scorching temperatures of over 40°C during the day, it&#8217;s also smog season with high PM 2.5 values and frequent alerts not to exercise outdoors. We usually get the Air Quality Index (AQI) from apps like IQAir AirVisual, or people can install air quality monitors in fixed locations to get local readings. But the small size (4.4 x 3.0 x 20 mm³) of the Bosch BMV080 can enable PM2.5 monitoring in wearables or other small devices like the PurpleAir PIXEL USB dongle.

<p>I went through an unboxing and Debian 12 installation on the Radxa Orion O6 at the end of January, but decided to work on other reviews since software support still needed to be worked on. Since then, there&#8217;s been some work done, but no new image released. After waiting for almost two months, I&#8217;ve decided to carry on with the review by testing the Debian 12 image in a way similar to the Rock 5B SBC preview I did with Debian 11 in 2022 to check what works and what doesn&#8217;t on the Orion O6 at the time of the review. That will involve testing all ports, including 5GbE networking and the PCIe slot with an (old) NVIDIA graphics card, running some benchmarks, and also trying the Debian 12 image with a self-built Linux 6.13 kernel using ACPI instead of UEFI for the default image.
