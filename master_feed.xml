<p>The price of DDR4 memory has increased dramatically in recent months due to limited supply and increased demand for AI workloads. The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and 5 (CM4/CM5) are based on LPDDR4 memory, and Raspberry Pi reports that memory costs are roughly 120% higher than they were just a year ago. So they have no choice but to increase the price by $5 to $10 for the CM4 and CM5, as well as the Raspberry Pi 500 keyboard PC. I assume the $200 price tag for the Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keyboard PC released last week already includes this new reality. Product affected: 4GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $5 8GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $10 Raspberry Pi 500 unit-only increases by $10 to $100 Raspberry Pi Development Kit for Compute Module 5 increases by $5 to [...]</p>

<p>Linux 6.17 has just been released on LKML: No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go. Below is the shortlog for just the last week &#8211; not the full 6.17 release &#8211; as usual. It&#8217;s not exciting, which is all good. I think the biggest patch in there is some locking fixes for some bluetooth races that could cause use-after-free situations. Whee &#8211; that&#8217;s about as exciting as it gets. Other than that, there&#8217; the usual driver fixlets (GPU and networking dominate as usual, but &#8220;dominate&#8221; is still pretty small), there&#8217;s some minor random other driver updates, some filesystem noise, and core kernel and mm. And some selftest updates. This obviously means that the merge window for 6.18 will open tomorrow, and I already have four dozen pull requests pending. Thanks to the proactive people &#8211; you know who [...]</p>

<p>LUNYEE has sent us a review sample of the 4040 PRO CNC router, featuring a larger work volume than the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra model we reviewed a few months ago. It is designed for milling and engraving tasks that demand high precision and features a robust structure to support continuous operation. It works with wood, plastic, and acrylic. Its standout feature is the complete set of accessories, such as the Probe system for Z-axis setup and a workpiece clamping kit, allowing users to get started right away. This makes it an ideal CNC Router for beginners in engraving work. We&#8217;ve previously reviewed the smaller 3018 Pro Ultra with Easel, but we&#8217;ll instead use Candle software on the 4040 PRO machine.

<p>Fing has recently introduced the &#8220;Fing Agent Raspberry Pi Kit&#8220;, also called &#8220;Fing Agent plug-and-play Raspberry Pi 4 kit&#8221;, for its Fing Agent network monitoring system, which can be considered a follow-up to the earlier Fingbox hardware released in 2017. While Fingbox was a custom appliance based on Ubuntu Core, the new kit uses a Raspberry Pi, making it easier to set up and use in a home or small office network. The kit includes a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB) in an aluminium case, a 32GB microSD card with Fing Agent preinstalled, a USB-C power supply with adapters, and a Cat 5e Ethernet cable. Once connected to the router, it works with the Fing app, desktop, or web to monitor devices, track uptime and speed, detect intrusions, and send alerts about unusual activity.

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from cloud-first architectures to edge-first designs, so more processing now runs on phones, cameras, and embedded controllers. Running inference on-device cuts latency and keeps sensitive data local. This momentum is reshaping product roadmaps, all due to different revolutions driven by edge AI. The Core Revolutions Driven by Edge AI Instead of routing every model and signal to the cloud, devices are processing more data locally to act faster and protect sensitive information. Because edge AI is changing where intelligence runs, IDC estimates global spending on edge computing reached about $261 billion in 2025. This rapid enterprise investment is due to several reasons. 1. Enabling Real-Time, On-Device Decisions Eliminating the cloud round-trip lets devices turn sensor input into action in milliseconds.

<p>Compex Systems (Compex) is redefining how wireless is integrated into modern embedded and industrial systems with the launch of JustWiFi⁷™, a one-of-a-kind, driverless, tri-band concurrent Wi-Fi 7 module that connects through Ethernet protocols. Designed to eliminate the complexity of traditional wireless integration, JustWiFi⁷™ makes high-performance Wi-Fi deployment faster, simpler, and smarter. Rethinking Wi-Fi Integration: No Drivers. No Hassle. JustWiFi⁷™ Most of the Wi-Fi modules today rely on PCIe, SDIO, or USB interfaces and are controlled through drivers. Developers will need to deal with the drivers&#8217; compatibility with the host platform, particularly its OS and kernel version. The drivers for Wi-Fi 7 are particularly complex due to the standard&#8217;s advanced features. Many open-sourced drivers and sometimes the host CPU are not able to deliver the full capabilities of the Wi-Fi 7 chipset. These complications often unnecessarily slow down and add to the development time and effort. Engineered for speed, simplicity, and [...]</p>
