<p>When 3D printing, users will always waste filament one way or the other, either due to a failed print or because of the support for the print, and there may also be test/old prints that you don&#8217;t need/use anymore, for example, a retraction cube or a benchy. That means all that material usually ends up in the dustbin. Priyank Pal, founder of Creative3dp, did not like all that waste, so he created the ExtrudeX machine to recycle 3D print waste and filament scraps back into usable filament. On top of that, the machine itself is 3D printable and much more affordable than commercial solutions from companies such as Filabot. I&#8217;d usually provide the specifications here, but as a crowdfunded project, the ExtrudeX&#8217;s full technical details are not fully available. We just know that a single DC gear motor drives the main screw inside a metal barrel, while band heaters and [...]</p>

<p>But there <em>is</em> a way to hack it.

<p>One interesting addition to the just-released Linux 6.18 kernel is the Tyr Rust GPU driver for CSF-based Arm Mali GPUs, which is a port of the mature Panthor C GPU driver merged into Linux 6.10. It was developed by Collabora in collaboration with Arm and Google. Tyr aims to implement the same userspace API offered by Panthor, so that it can eventually be used as a drop-in replacement in the company&#8217;s PanVK Vulkan driver. After several years, the Tyr Rust driver might replace the Panthor C driver, but in the meantime, Panthor will keep being used since it is more mature and conformant with OpenGL ES 3.1 since July 2024. The work on Tyr is fairly advanced, and Collabora provided an update at the end of November. The key takeaway is that the Tyr (prototype) driver works with  GNOME, Weston, and even full-screen 3D games like SuperTuxKart while matching the [...]</p>

<p>Last October, Raspberry Pi had to increase the price of its CM4/CM5 Compute Modules due to DDR4 supply constraints. Now the company has had to do the same for the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 single board computers, and launched the Raspberry Pi 5 1GB for people wanting a lower cost option. They could not get the traditional $35 price tag, and the new low-cost Pi 5 sells for $45. Here&#8217;s what the old and new prices are. $145 for a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB starts to be really stiff, especially since that&#8217;s only the board we are talking about here.

<p>NetCube Systems Nagami is a small Allwinner T113-S3 system-on-module that I just saw added to Linux 6.18. Besides mainline Linux support, the Allwinner SoM offers somewhat unique or unusual features that include a mini PCIe form factor and an ESP32 co-processor for WiFi 4 and Bluetooth connectivity. The Nagami also comes with 128MB DDR3 embedded in the T113-S3, 4GB eMMC flash, a Fast Ethernet PHY, and a Qwiic connector for I2C expansion modules. All I/Os are exposed through a standard mini PCIe edge connector: audio I/Os, Ethernet, USB 2.0 OTG/host, and a range of low-speed I/Os. Nagami SoM specifications: SoC – Allwinner T113-S3 CPU – Dual-core Arm Cortex-A7 @ 1.2 GHz with 32 KB L1 I-cache + 32 KB L1 D-cache per core, and 256 KB L2 cache DSP – Single-core HiFi4 VPU – H.265/H.264 video decoding up to 1080p60 and JPEG/MJPEG video encoding up to 1080p60 Memory – 128 [...]</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.18 on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), which will likely become the next LTS kernel [update: it&#8217;s now official]: So I&#8217;ll have to admit that I&#8217;d have been happier with slightly less bugfixing noise in this last week of the release, but while there&#8217;s a few more fixes than I would hope for, there was nothing that made me feel like this needs more time to cook. So 6.18 is tagged and pushed out. Most of the last-minute fixes are minor fixes to drivers, with some random noise elsewhere (bluetooth, ceph, afs..). Nothing strikes me as standing out, but hey, there&#8217;s a shortlog appended if you want to see the details. And this obviously means that the merge window will open tomorrow, and I already have three dozen pull requests pending. Thanks. And as I already mentioned a couple of [...]</p>

<p>Chen Liang (陳亮) has found an interesting use case for the Espressif ESP32-C5: a dual-band Wi-Fi analyzer showing the signal strength of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi access points in your area. It works like one of the Wi-Fi analyzer apps on your phone, except it relies on an ESP32-C5 board and a display support for the Arduino_GFX libraries, for example, based on the ILI9341 driver, as it&#8217;s easier for beginners since the code does not need to be changed. Here&#8217;s what it looks like. You can follow the instructions provided by Chen to reproduce the setup. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward. He specifically used an ESP32-C5-DevkitC-1 board (or one of the clones) along with an ILI9341 display (not sure about the exact model, but any should do) and wired them together using a breadboard as shown in the photo below. You&#8217;ll then need to fire up the Arduino IDE, install Arduino [...]</p>

<p>This air quality monitor costs $250. It's called the <a href="https://networkedartifacts.com/airlab">Air Lab</a>, and I've been using it to measure the air in my car, home, studio, and a few events over the past few months. And in using it over the course of a road trip I learned to not run recirculate in my car quite as often—more on that later.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Out of the box, if you buy a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, install it on the official CM5 IO Board, and install a fan on it (e.g. my current favorite, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/edatec/ED-CM5ACOOLER/25696857">EDAtec CM5 Active Cooler</a>), you'll notice the fan ramps up to 100% speed after you shut down the Pi.</p>

<p>That's not fun, since at least for a couple of my CM5s, they are more often powered down than running, creating a slight cacophany!</p></div>

<p>While the hot dog's flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"><em>Amplitude</em> Modulation</a>, where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down. Just like a speaker cone moving up and down, the plasma arc from the hot dog turns that modulation into audible sound.</p></div>
