<p>Argon 40 is better known for its Argon ONE Raspberry Pi enclosures, but the company has now launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Argon ONE UP 14-inch laptop powered by the Raspberry Pi CM5 module. We&#8217;ve already covered a range of Raspberry Pi 4/5 laptops, but existing models are either rather thick or the Raspberry Pi 5 is placed on the side of a laptop shell, not ideal for portability. The Argon ONE UP looks like a proper laptop, as thin as a typical consumer laptop, while keeping Raspberry Pi features such as access to the GPIO pins. The description is rather garbage, like on all recent Kickstarter campaigns we&#8217;ve covered, with low-resolution GIF animations and text in photos (instead of actual text), but I did my best to reconstruct the Argon ONE UP specifications: SoM &#8211; Raspberry Pi CM5 (included or BYO) SoC – Broadcom BCM2712 CPU – Quad-core [...]</p>

<p>Hengbot Sirius is a small AI robotic dog that can be trained by users with &#8220;manual teaching&#8221; and by developers using tools such as Sirius Creator Studio Pro and C or Python APIs. Features include an 8MP camera, a dual-mic array, and a speaker for user interaction using LLMs, text-to-speech, voice recognition, and computer vision leveraging the built-in 5 TOPS AI accelerator, a small LCD, a few RGB LEDs and sensors, and 14 DoF for legs and the head. We&#8217;ve seen plenty of other robot dogs over the years, such as the Hiwonder MechDog, the Raspberry Pi CM4-based CM4 XGO Lite smart robot dog, Mini Pupper 2, and Petoi Bittle, among others. Most are more robot-like than dog-like, and the Sirius has a more appealing design closer to a real dog.

<p>While child-sized humanoid robots like the Unitree R1 have come down in price, not everybody has a spare $6,000 to throw around to play with robots, and smaller models like the Tonybot are more affordable for educational purposes. The Tonybot offers 17 degrees of freedom, relies on high-voltage bus servos and anti-blockage servos, and has a separate ESP32 expansion board for extra modules. Optionally equipped with an ESP32-S3 AI vision camera and an AI voice integration module, the 38cm tall humanoid robot supports object and face recognition, color and line following tracking, human-robot interaction, fall recovery, obstacle avoidance, and more, besides walking, dancing, etc&#8230; Tonybot specifications: H5S Robot Controller Storage &#8211; MicroSD card socket 6x servo ports, head module port Bluetooth/MP3 module header Sensor &#8211; Accelerometer Debugging &#8211; 4-pin UART header Misc ON/OFF switch Buzzer Power Supply Via DC jack Terminal block for battery ESP32 Expansion Board ESP32-DevKitC board PWM [...]</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just written about Will Whang’s RPI5-SDexpress-Hat board, which adds a microSD Express slot to the Raspberry Pi 5, but it&#8217;s not that small, and it&#8217;s using the 40-pin GPIO for power, so it&#8217;s not convenient if you want to install another Raspberry Pi HAT+. Vassily Petrov&#8217;s &#8220;microSD-express Pi Adapter&#8221; is a much smaller microSD Express adapter on a flexible PCB that plugs directly into the PCIe FFC connector and nothing else, driving power from the PCIe connector only. There&#8217;s not much on the PCB itself besides a microSD Express card slot and a Microchip MIC2230 800mA/800mA step-down DC/DC regulator.  We&#8217;re told speeds of up to 800 MB/s are achievable, limited by the PCIe Gen3 x1 interface on the Pi 5 itself. For reference, the RPI5-SDexpress-Hat was tested at about 600 MB/s for sequential reads and under 200MB/s for sequential writes using a 256GB Samsung microSD Express card. A worry [...]</p>

<p>THIRDREALITY Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1 may look like a traditional mechanical keyboard, but it supports the Matter protocol to double as a Smart Home controller. I initially thought it was a ridiculous idea, but as someone who spends 8 hours or more a day in front of a keyboard, it could be quite convenient. Simply press the F1 to F12 keys to control lights, adjust air conditioners, smart shades, and more with minimal distraction. So let&#8217;s have a look at the MK1 in more detail.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>The Raspberry Pi RP2350 dual-core Arm/RISC-V has gotten a new version &#8211; A4 stepping &#8211; addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities, notably the infamous E9 GPIO erratum and glitching bugs in the A2 stepping identified by the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Both RP2350A and RP2350B variants will benefit from the new stepping and be marked RP2350A0A4 and RP2350B0A4, respectively. The company also announced the availability of the 2MB flash variants, the RP2354A and RP2354B (unveiled in March 2025), that do not require flash on the board. RP2350 A4 stepping highlights: Fixes Glitching bugs identified in the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Exploits required physical access to the chip. The E9 GPIO erratum related to GPIO pull-ups. A4 stepping is a drop-in replacement for the earlier A2 stepping. 5V-tolerant GPIOs; Note: the chip must remain powered while 5V IOs are used (See updated datasheet for details) RP2354A and RP2354B variants with 2MB of stacked-in-package QSPI [...]</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.16 on LKML: It&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, and the release cycle has come to an end. Last week was nice and calm, and there were no big show-stopper surprises to keep us from the regular schedule, so I&#8217;ve tagged and pushed out 6.16 as planned. It&#8217;s worth noting that the upcoming merge window for 6.17 is going to be slightly chaotic for me: I have multiple family events this August (a wedding and a big birthday), and with said family being spread not only across the US, but in Finland too, I&#8217;m spending about half the month traveling. That means that I will try very hard to get most of the merge window done the first week before my travels start, and I already ended upgiving a heads-up on that to the people who tend to send me the most pull requests.

<p>At the time, there was no option for upgrading the M4 Pro Mac mini, despite it <em>also</em> using a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121003">user-replaceable</a>, socketed storage drive.</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>
