<p>While Meshtastic is by far the most popular off-grid messaging solution relying on LoRa radios, MeshCore offers an alternative as a lightweight C++ library and firmware designed for multi-hop packet routing and made for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet. The project&#8217;s GitHub repository provides some high-level differences compared to the Meshtastic and Reticulum projects: MeshCore provides the ability to create wireless mesh networks, similar to Meshtastic and Reticulum but with a focus on lightweight multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects. Unlike Meshtastic, which is tailored for casual LoRa communication, or Reticulum, which offers advanced networking, MeshCore balances simplicity with scalability, making it ideal for custom embedded solutions., where devices (nodes) can communicate over long distances by relaying messages through intermediate nodes. This is especially useful in off-grid, emergency, or tactical situations where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable. MeshCore key features: Multi-hop [...]</p>

<p>While searching Aliexpress for new products, I found out about the JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV from the Maker Go AliExpress store, another ESP32-P4 development board with features very similar to the  ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board or the Wireless Tag WT99P4C5-S1 board, but built around the GUITION JC-ESP32P4-M3-C6 module, which combines ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C6 into a single package instead of having separate chips or modules on most other designs. Features include 32MB of PSRAM and 16MB of flash on the GUITION module, a microSD card slot for storage, a built-in microphone, speaker output via the ES8311 audio codec, and an audio amplifier. The board also offers a 10/100Mbps Ethernet RJ45 port, an RS-485 terminal block, a GPIO header, and expansion connectors for both the ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C6 chips. Additionally, there are three USB ports: two USB-C and one USB-A for power, data, and debugging, along with a few buttons and LEDs.

<p>Renesas has recently launched the RA2T1 group of low-power motor control MCUs, built around a 64 MHz Arm Cortex-M23, for low-cost single-motor applications like power tools, fans, and home appliances. Designed for Brushless DC Electric Motors (BLDC) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSM), the RA2T1 supports both trapezoidal and FOC control techniques, thanks to its integrated 3-channel Sample and Hold (S&#38;H) circuits that enable accurate 3-phase current detection. It also includes PWM shutdown features and various analog and digital peripherals in compact packages as small as 4&#215;4 mm QFN. Previously, Renesas introduced the RA8T1, also a motor control MCU based on the Cortex-M85 core with Helium instructions and DSP extensions. Ideal for AI-enhanced motor control in industrial and robotics applications. Around the same time, Infineon launched the PSOC Control C3x series, with real-time motor control and security features along with fast ADCs, high-resolution PWM, and PSA Level 2 compliance.

<p>USB-to-serial debug boards are commonly used for board bring-up, checking for issues when a board does not boot, or accessing the serial console in systems without networking or video output. You&#8217;d just connect GND, Tx, and Rx wires to the target board, and a USB cable to the host, before running a terminal program like Putty, Minicom, or Bootterm with the correct parameters, and you should be good to go. That&#8217;s the theory, but sometimes Tx and Rx may be inverted, the baudrate is not advertised, and so on. So Excamera Labs decided to make the TermDriver 2, an improved USB-to-serial with a small built-in display to more easily debug those issues. It can also be used in standalone mode, showing the serial console output on the tiny screen without having to connect it to a host.

<p>The 4-Ch PCIe FFC Adapter Board expands the PCIe interface of the Raspberry Pi 5 to four PCIe FFC connectors using the ASM1184e PCI Express packet switch chip, which we&#8217;ve seen in HATs like the Geekworm X1011 board, adding four NVMe SSDs, and the Waveshare PCIe-Packet-Switch-4P, adding four PCIe x1 slots. The HAT supports PCIe Gen2 speeds and features onboard power monitoring to track power consumption. There is also an EEPROM for storing configuration data, and the option to stack multiple PCIe HATs. Additionally, users can install a heatsink on the HAT to manage thermal performance, making it well-suited for embedded solutions that require multiple PCIe devices.

<p>RISC-V is an open architecture standard that provides flexibility, and chip designers can add or remove instructions as they please to match their application requirements. That&#8217;s all great until complex software designed to run on multiple platforms is involved. That&#8217;s why for Linux and Android support, the RVA (RISC-V Application) profiles were created, so that every RISC-V SoC designed for those systems meets some minimal requirements and shared instructions, to which you would also add more if needed, as long as they don&#8217;t break the standard. The RISC-V association ratified the latest RVA23 profile for 64-bit RISC-V in October 2024, which notably mandates support for the vector and hypervisor extensions. OMGUbuntu also reports that Canonical has decided to raise the required RISC-V ISA profile family to RVA23, or more exactly RVA23U64, from RVA20 for the upcoming Ubuntu 25.10 release. In other words, going forward, Ubuntu will only be supported on [...]</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've had a Pi and SDR earmarked for 'getting weather data from my weather station' for a long time now. I don't know why I waited so long, because it was shockingly easy.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p></div>
