<p>SMLight&#8217;s SMHUB Nano Mg24 may look like the company&#8217;s earlier SLZB-06p Zigbee to Ethernet/WiFi/USB coordinators, but it&#8217;s a more powerful Linux-based Zigbee/Thread Smart Hub that pairs SOPHGO SG2000 RISC-V SoC with Silicon Labs MG24 multi-protocol wireless MCU. Unlike traditional Zigbee/Thread adapters that connect to a host through USB or Ethernet, the SMHUB Nano Mg24 is an all-in-one solution that runs all major automation apps directly on the device, eliminating the need for a Raspberry Pi, Mini PC, or other hardware server.

<p>Chen Liang (陳亮) has found an interesting use case for the Espressif ESP32-C5: a dual-band Wi-Fi analyzer showing the signal strength of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi access points in your area. It works like one of the Wi-Fi analyzer apps on your phone, except it relies on an ESP32-C5 board and a display support for the Arduino_GFX libraries, for example, based on the ILI9341 driver, as it&#8217;s easier for beginners since the code does not need to be changed. Here&#8217;s what it looks like. You can follow the instructions provided by Chen to reproduce the setup. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward. He specifically used an ESP32-C5-DevkitC-1 board (or one of the clones) along with an ILI9341 display (not sure about the exact model, but any should do) and wired them together using a breadboard as shown in the photo below. You&#8217;ll then need to fire up the Arduino IDE, install Arduino [...]</p>

<p>Banana Pi BPI-CM6 system-on-module (SoM) is powered by a SpacemiT K1 octa-core RISC-V processor and compatible with most carrier boards for the Raspberry Pi CM4 or CM5 modules. It ships with 8GB LPDDR4 and 16GB eMMC flash by default, a Gigabit Ethernet PHY, and a WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.1 wireless module. It exposes most interfaces through three 100-pin board-to-board connectors with HDMI 1.4, MIPI DSI, three MIPI CSI, five PCIe 2.1 lanes, USB 3.2/2.0 interfaces, and more. While it can work with Raspberry Pi CM4/CM5 carrier boards using two of the B2B connectors, the company also designed the BPI-CM6 IO carrier board to make full use of all the interfaces, especially the PCIe lanes.

<p>Earlier this month, we checked the specifications and did an unboxing of the Sermoon S1 high-end 3D scanner with support for blue laser and infrared scanning. I had some concerns about my host machines due to the fairly high minimum requirements: Intel Core i7 Gen7 CPU, NVIDIA GPU (6GB VRAM), 16GB RAM, Windows 10/11 (64-bit). I had planned to use an ASUS Vivobook 16 laptop with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5-13500H SoC with a 12-core Raptor Lake processor and integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics, as well as 16GB of RAM to run Creality Scan 4 software. After talking with Creality, it was confirmed to me that a &#8220;dedicated graphics card&#8221; was required. I have some good and bad news. The good news is that I might get a mini PC with an NVIDIA RTX 5060 Ti (16GB) external GPU for review. The bad news is that I have to [...]</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi Imager 2.0 has just been released with a revamped user interface with a wizard to enable easier navigation, as well as a new option for Raspberry Pi Connect remote access, among other changes. The Raspberry Pi Imager was first released in March 2020 to improve the user experience when flashing OS images for the Raspberry Pi to a microSD card. No need to download an OS image from the website and flash it manually to a microSD card with the dd command line tool, Win32DiskImager, or BalenaEtcher. Just select your Raspberry Pi model, the image you want from a curated list, and the storage device, and you&#8217;re good to go.  A popular feature was the OS customization settings, but the list grew quite large, and that&#8217;s one of the main reasons for the release of the Raspberry Pi Imager 2.0 utility.

<p>Alex Taradov has designed a low-cost, open-source hardware USB sniffer compatible with the popular Wireshark packet capture utility, and also controllable from the command line, capturing data in the standard PcapNG format in either case. Wireshark has had built-in USB capture capability for many years, and I used it myself to reverse-engineer the software for a USB video capture card around 2007, but it&#8217;s not perfect since it does not capture low-level packets. For that, you need extra hardware, and last year we covered the tinysniffer USB sniffer based on a WiFi-connected Linux SBC. It does the job, but it&#8217;s sold for $199, and you don&#8217;t need an application processor to handle USB 2.0 speeds. Alex&#8217;s design is optimized for cost and built around three main components: Cypress CY7C68013A 8051 MCU, Lattice MachXO2 LCMXO2 FPGA, and Microchip USB3343 USB PHY. Taradov&#8217;s USB sniffer specifications: Microcontroller &#8211; Cypress CY7C68013A enhanced 8051 [...]</p>

<p>The Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) will release the AV2 open video codec specification by the end of the year, as an update of the now widely-used AV1 video codec with up to 40% bandwidth reduction at the same level of quality. In the meantime, Debargha Mukherjee, Google Principal Engineer, has shared a progress report about AV2, first offering a historical perspective with the list of digital video codecs from 1990 to 2030 (expected), then stating AV2 goals, and going through requirements, coding tools, and what&#8217;s been achieved so far. You can check the eleven-minute presentation (04:27 &#8211; 15:30) embedded at the end of this post, or continue reading for the highlights of the talk. AV2 will be released very soon, while the H.267 proprietary video codec might only be released around 2030. We haven&#8217;t seen a lot of support/traction for H.266, so we&#8217;ll have to see if H.267 ever [...]</p>

<p>While the hot dog's flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"><em>Amplitude</em> Modulation</a>, where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down.

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p></div>
