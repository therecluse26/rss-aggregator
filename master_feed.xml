<p>TRMNL is a 7-5-inch wireless E-Ink display based on an ESP32-C3 RISC-V WiFi and Bluetooth SoC and designed to be customizable, allowing users to disassemble their device, modify the (open-source) firmware, and retrieve API keys without voiding the warranty. The default 1,800 mAh battery is good enough for over 3 months on a charge, but the company also provides an option for a 2,500 mAh battery that is said to last for more than 6 months (not sure how the math works here).Â  The wireless display can be placed on a desktop, or mounted on a wall or a fridge.

<p>AI-On-The-Edge-Cam is an ESP32-S3 board with a 2MP camera, microSD card, WiFi, BLE, and PoE Ethernet connectivity designed to digitize legacy utility meters such as water meters, gas meters, or electricity meters that require manual onsite reading. AI-On-The-Edge-Cam is also the name of the firmware running on the board and was initially designed for the ESP32-CAM board. But the new board adds a few features that make it more versatile, like PoE support and a microSD card slot for storage, as well as RGB LEDs acting as a flash to allow meter reading at any time of the day or night.

<p>SolidRun SolidSense AIoT is an AI vision development platform designed based on the company&#8217;s Renesas RZ/V2N or Hailo-15 system-on-module with 15 TOPS and 20 TOPS of AI performance, respectively. The solution comes with up to 8GB RAM, 256GB eMMC flash, WiFi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and LTE Cat 1bis connectivity, an 8.4MP Sony IMX678 camera, four IR LEDs, and a few sensors all housed in an IP64-rated enclosure for outdoor operation. The SolidSense AIoT platform takes three 18650 rechargeable batteries with USB-C charging and an optional solar panel.

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest post by Ohad Peled, Product Marketing Manager at Sony Semiconductor Israel, about the challenges of tracking a large number of IoT assets and how LTE-M can help businesses scale tracking solutions. Over the last few years, asset tracking has emerged as a critical business function and is estimated to grow to a $34.5B market by 2032, according to Custom Market Insights. Whether businesses are monitoring a global supply chain or keeping tabs on expensive equipment, knowing where assets are at all times is essential. It enables businesses to optimize supply chains, prevent theft, and reduce operational downtime. There are several technical and commercial challenges in deploying such a solution, which could result in failure to deliver the promised value. Some solutions struggle to maintain accurate tracking as assets move within or across different facilities, especially if they go through an indoor environment. Others suffer from [...]</p>

<p>Pinefeat has designed an EF/EF-S lens controller and adapter for the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, compatible with Canon lenses, and implementing full electronic control of autofocus and aperture. Canon EF (Electro-Focus) and EF-S (Electro-Focus Short Back Focus) lenses are designed for the company&#8217;s DSLR cameras with an EOS (electronic autofocus system). They have great optics, built-in motors taking care of focusing, and also handle aperture electronically.

<p>Designed by MuseLab, the nanoCH57x is a WCH CH570/CH572 development board with a 2.4 GHz proprietary radio (CH570) or Bluetooth LE (CH572) that only costs $3.50 and is more compact than the official CH570 Basic Evaluation Board. We first came across this low-cost MCU back in March this year, and saw that the official development board became available for purchase as early as April. The nanoCH57x development board currently features the 100 MHzÂ  CH572D RISC-V microcontroller (the CH570D version is coming later), which includes 256KB of flash memory, 12KB of SRAM, and an onboard 32 MHz crystal. The board also includes a USB 2.0 Type-C Host/Device port and PCB antenna for BLE/RF communication.

<p>The AgroSense AGLW2CT is a dual-channel LoRaWAN-based industrial AC energy meter that utilizes 10A and 100A CT clamps to measure power consumption non-invasively. The device features two 0â5V analog inputs for the clamps, an AHT20 temperature &#38; humidity sensor, and local storage for 3,300+ records. It supports LoRaWAN 1.0.3 OTAA Class C and works with TTN, Datacake, and CloudStudio. The device operates within the -40Â°C to 85Â°C industrial temperature range and is suitable for contactless current sensing, overload/no-load detection, and machine health monitoring. We had previously covered, and even reviewed, several Wi-Fi-connected CT clamps meters such as the MachineQ&#8217;s MQpower CT, Seeed Studio&#8217;s XIAO-2CH-EM, and Emporia&#8217;s Vue Gen 2 energy monitor, but it&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve come across a LoRa AC energy meter with CT clamps.

<p>The NFC Forum has just announced NFC Release 15 that quadruples NFC range from 0.5cm to 2cm and enables faster, more reliable contactless interactions for wireless charging, kitchen appliances, wearables, and digital keys. The extended NFC range, also known as the operating volume, may make some people laugh since it&#8217;s only 2 cm we are talking about, but it has practical applications, as NFC contactless interactions will start sooner and require less precise device alignment. The NFC Release 15 also focuses on the NFC Digital Product Passport Standard to provide a data-agnostic framework allowing a single NFC tag to store and transmit both standard and extended DPP data using common NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) records. I wish I could explain how the extended NFC range and DPP standard are implemented in the new release, but I can&#8217;t because the technical specifications are only available for download to NFC Forum [...]</p>

<p>The ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 is a development board based on the ESP32-C61 low-cost WiFi 6 and Bluetooth LE 5.0 SoC that was first unveiled in January 2024, and has just entered mass production this month (June 2025). The board is offered with two USB-C ports, two buttons, an RGB LED, and GPIO headers. In my 2024 year in review report, I noted that Espressif would likely launch the ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 SoC in 2025, but I completely forgot about the ESP32-C61, which is basically a cost-down version of the ESP32-C6.

<p>Most ESP32-P4 boards and development platforms we&#8217;ve covered so far include an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-C5 wireless module, and in case you don&#8217;t want any WiFi and Bluetooth module, the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit is one option that comes with Ethernet instead. The ALIENTEK DNESP32P4M board, also called ESP32P4M MINI, adds another option with a form factor similar to Espressif Systems Devkit-C boards. The board does not have network connectivity at all, and exposes all I/Os from the ESP32-P4 through headers, MIPI DSI and MIPI CSI connectors, and two USB-C ports.

<p>MicroSui (Sui Embedded Framework) is a lightweight, modular, open-source C framework that brings the Sui Network to microcontrollers from low-end 8-bit MCUs like AVR to more powerful 32-bit SoCs like the ESP32. Wait&#8230; What&#8217;s the Sui Network / Protocol exactly? It&#8217;s a blockchain platform designed for high-speed, scalable, and low-cost decentralized applications, which was introduced in May 2023 by Mysten Labs, a company founded by former Meta engineers. It competes with networks like Solana and Ethereum but with better performance. So far, the Sui Network works with web and mobile applications, but MicroSui aims to expand its usage to resource-constrained embedded devices. We&#8217;re told MicroSui provides support for all core operations such as key management, transaction construction, signing, and broadcast. It is a pure-C library with no OS dependency or dynamic memory usage, so it can be deployed on a wide range of microcontrollers. Higher-end microcontrollers with Internet access, such [...]</p>

<p>The PCIe 7.0 specification has been released, offering a data rate of up to 128GT/s, or a bi-directional transfer rate of 512GB/s in x16 configuration. This doubles the speed of PCIe 6.0 specification released in 2022, reaching up to 64GT/s data rate, or 256GB/s bi-directional transfer rates. PCI-SIG says the PCIe 7.0 specification targets data-intensive applications such as AI/ML, 800 Gbps Ethernet, cloud, and Quantum computing. Work on PCIe 8.0 has started, likely aiming for 256GT/s and a 2028 release date. Like PCIe 6.0, PCIe 7.0 utilizes PAM4 (Pulse Amplitude Modulation with 4 levels) signaling and Flit-based encoding. It also provides improved power efficiency and maintains backwards compatibility with previous generations of PCIe technology. New specifications are released regularly, and since the introduction of PCI in 1992 with a 013GB/s data rate, the PCI/PCIe bandwidth has roughly doubled every three years, as illustrated in the chart below.

<p>The SD Association released the SD 7.1 standard with support for cards compliant with the microSD Express standard, enabling SSD-like performance on microSD cards by using a PCIe/NVMe interface, and more recent updates to the standard even enable speeds of up to 2GB/s. Saying that adoption has been slow would be an understatement, but things have changed recently, thanks to the introduction of the Nintendo Switch 2 portable game console, the first mainstream device to support the new standard. NVNT has had fun with it by designing a microSD Express to M.2 NVMe adapter (SDEX2M2) for the Nintendo Switch 2 or other devices supporting the microSD Express standard. The board design is pretty simple because it simply routes the PCIe signals from an M.2 NVMe 2230 SSD to the microSD Express connector. Three components can be found on the board: an M.2 2230 M-socket, a 220Î© ferrite bead, and an [...]</p>
