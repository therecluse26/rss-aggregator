<p>USB-to-serial debug boards are commonly used for board bring-up, checking for issues when a board does not boot, or accessing the serial console in systems without networking or video output. You&#8217;d just connect GND, Tx, and Rx wires to the target board, and a USB cable to the host, before running a terminal program like Putty, Minicom, or Bootterm with the correct parameters, and you should be good to go. That&#8217;s the theory, but sometimes Tx and Rx may be inverted, the baudrate is not advertised, and so on. So Excamera Labs decided to make the TermDriver 2, an improved USB-to-serial with a small built-in display to more easily debug those issues. It can also be used in standalone mode, showing the serial console output on the tiny screen without having to connect it to a host.

<p>The 4-Ch PCIe FFC Adapter Board expands the PCIe interface of the Raspberry Pi 5 to four PCIe FFC connectors using the ASM1184e PCI Express packet switch chip, which we&#8217;ve seen in HATs like the Geekworm X1011 board, adding four NVMe SSDs, and the Waveshare PCIe-Packet-Switch-4P, adding four PCIe x1 slots. The HAT supports PCIe Gen2 speeds and features onboard power monitoring to track power consumption. There is also an EEPROM for storing configuration data, and the option to stack multiple PCIe HATs. Additionally, users can install a heatsink on the HAT to manage thermal performance, making it well-suited for embedded solutions that require multiple PCIe devices. Waveshare PCIe TO 4-CH HAT specifications: Compatibility – Designed for Raspberry Pi 5 Storage – Onboard EEPROM for configuration data storage PCIe switch – ASMedia ASM1184e PCI express packet switch with 1x PCIe Gen2 x1 upstream port and 4x PCIe Gen2 x1 downstream [...]</p>

<p>RISC-V is an open architecture standard that provides flexibility, and chip designers can add or remove instructions as they please to match their application requirements. That&#8217;s all great until complex software designed to run on multiple platforms is involved. That&#8217;s why for Linux and Android support, the RVA (RISC-V Application) profiles were created, so that every RISC-V SoC designed for those systems meets some minimal requirements and shared instructions, to which you would also add more if needed, as long as they don&#8217;t break the standard. The RISC-V association ratified the latest RVA23 profile for 64-bit RISC-V in October 2024, which notably mandates support for the vector and hypervisor extensions. OMGUbuntu also reports that Canonical has decided to raise the required RISC-V ISA profile family to RVA23, or more exactly RVA23U64, from RVA20 for the upcoming Ubuntu 25.10 release. In other words, going forward, Ubuntu will only be supported on [...]</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about Meshtastic firmware and hardware since 2020, but I never had the opportunity to test it myself. This has now changed as Elecrow sent us the ThinkNode M1 and ThinkNode M2 Meshtastic nodes for review. Both rely on Semtech SX162x radios, but the M1 is based on a Nordic Semi nRF52840 Bluetooth MCU with a 1.54-inch E-Ink display and GPS, and the smaller M2 is based on an ESP32-S3 chip and a 1.3-inch OLED but lacks a built-in GPS module. Since I&#8217;ve never used Meshtastic before, this &#8220;review&#8221; will be more like a Getting Started Guide from a beginner&#8217;s perspective. After an unboxing and a teardown, I&#8217;ll test messaging, GPS sharing, and the range I can get in a suburban environment in Thailand. ThinkNode M1/M2 unboxing Both packages look similar, with a plastic case and a white cover. The ThinkNode M1&#8217;s main features include a high-gain antenna, [...]</p>

<p>The datasheets, user manuals, and Linux SDK for the Allwinner A527, T527, and A733 SoCs, found in some SBCs like the Avaota A1, Radxa Cubie A5E, Orange Pi 4A, and upcoming Cubie A7A, are now available on Gitlab without any NDA requirements. Allwinner SoCs used to be some of the most popular processors for SBCs in the years 2012 to 2015 due to their feature set, low cost, and support by the sunxi-linux community. Since then, interest has plummeted due to a lack of interest in open-source software by Allwinner management and the constant release of new low-cost &#8220;Cortex-A7&#8221; SoC, and Rockchip RK3566 or RK3588 are now preferred on non-Raspberry Pi SBCs.  But we first heard Allwinner say they planned to work on mainline Linux support for the Allwinner A527/T527 at the Orange Pi Developer Conference in March 2024.

<p>Grant Sinclair&#8217;s GamerCard is a handheld console based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a 4-inch color IPS display offered in an ultrathin design that&#8217;s about the size of a typical retail gift card. It joins other Raspberry Pi-based handheld terminals like the BeepBerry, ShaRPiKeebo, or DevTerm, but it&#8217;s more of a consumer device and offers by far the slimmest design at just 6mm thick. Being described as a &#8220;Grab &#38; Go Raspberry Pi Gaming&#8221; platform, it&#8217;s mainly designed as a portable gaming console, but since it&#8217;s based on Raspberry Pi hardware, you could also use it as a battery-powered Linux terminal connected to a USB keyboard and mouse, and it also offers expansion capabilities through a Qwiic connector.

<p>We have already checked out the specifications, assembled the machine, and performed basic tests with the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra CNC Router in the first part of the review. We&#8217;ve now had time to use the machine to carve text and logos on wood and aluminum. It was Suthinee&#8217;s first CNC machine, so the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra was reviewed from the point of view of a beginner. We used both the offline controller with files provided on the SD card and the Easel web-based CNC software.

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've had a Pi and SDR earmarked for 'getting weather data from my weather station' for a long time now. I don't know why I waited so long, because it was shockingly easy.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p></div>
