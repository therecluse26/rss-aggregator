<p>The Kappa4310Rasp is a Raspberry Pi-compatible Modbus RTU HAT designed to evaluate the IS4310 Modbus RTU Slave stack chip. This allows engineers to simulate sensor and actuator interactions using a push-button and RGB LED without requiring a custom board or soldering. The board features an RS-485 interface with two RJ45 connectors for daisy-chaining Modbus networks. The board communicates with the Raspberry Pi over I²C and supports 500 Holding Registers along with Function Codes 3 (Read Holding Registers), 6 (Write Single Register), and 16 (Write Multiple Registers). The HAT operates at 3.3V and includes jumpers to enable or disable onboard I²C pull-ups. Additional features include dedicated Tx/Rx indicator LEDs, a power LED, GPIO-connected RGB LEDs, and a push-button for real-time interaction.

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about Meshtastic firmware and hardware since 2020, but I never had the opportunity to test it myself. This has now changed as Elecrow sent us the ThinkNode M1 and ThinkNode M2 Meshtastic nodes for review. Both rely on Semtech SX162x radios, but the M1 is based on a Nordic Semi nRF52840 Bluetooth MCU with a 1.54-inch E-Ink display and GPS, and the smaller M2 is based on an ESP32-S3 chip and a 1.3-inch OLED but lacks a built-in GPS module. Since I&#8217;ve never used Meshtastic before, this &#8220;review&#8221; will be more like a Getting Started Guide from a beginner&#8217;s perspective. After an unboxing and a teardown, I&#8217;ll test messaging, GPS sharing, and the range I can get in a suburban environment in Thailand. ThinkNode M1/M2 unboxing Both packages look similar, with a plastic case and a white cover. The ThinkNode M1&#8217;s main features include a high-gain antenna, [...]</p>

<p>The datasheets, user manuals, and Linux SDK for the Allwinner A527, T527, and A733 SoCs, found in some SBCs like the Avaota A1, Radxa Cubie A5E, Orange Pi 4A, and upcoming Cubie A7A, are now available on Gitlab without any NDA requirements. Allwinner SoCs used to be some of the most popular processors for SBCs in the years 2012 to 2015 due to their feature set, low cost, and support by the sunxi-linux community. Since then, interest has plummeted due to a lack of interest in open-source software by Allwinner management and the constant release of new low-cost &#8220;Cortex-A7&#8221; SoC, and Rockchip RK3566 or RK3588 are now preferred on non-Raspberry Pi SBCs.  But we first heard Allwinner say they planned to work on mainline Linux support for the Allwinner A527/T527 at the Orange Pi Developer Conference in March 2024.

<p>Grant Sinclair&#8217;s GamerCard is a handheld console based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a 4-inch color IPS display offered in an ultrathin design that&#8217;s about the size of a typical retail gift card. It joins other Raspberry Pi-based handheld terminals like the BeepBerry, ShaRPiKeebo, or DevTerm, but it&#8217;s more of a consumer device and offers by far the slimmest design at just 6mm thick. Being described as a &#8220;Grab &#38; Go Raspberry Pi Gaming&#8221; platform, it&#8217;s mainly designed as a portable gaming console, but since it&#8217;s based on Raspberry Pi hardware, you could also use it as a battery-powered Linux terminal connected to a USB keyboard and mouse, and it also offers expansion capabilities through a Qwiic connector. GamerCard specifications: SBC &#8211; Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (soldered on mainboard) &#8211; Based on Raspberry Pi RP3A0 quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 SiP with 512 MB SDRAM, Bluetooth 4.2 and [...]</p>

We&#8217;ve now had time to use the machine to carve text and logos on wood and aluminum. It was Suthinee&#8217;s first CNC machine, so the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra was reviewed from the point of view of a beginner. We used both the offline controller with files provided on the SD card and the Easel web-based CNC software.

<p>Embedr is an AI-powered Arduino-like IDE designed to simplify development for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. It looks very similar to the Cursor code editor and uses Microsoft’s Monaco Editor and Arduino CLI tools to enable features such as intelligent code suggestions, project skeleton generation, and visual debugging. Embedr has all the Arduino features that you are familiar with, and on top of that, you can add other LLMs and experiment just by adding the required plugin and connecting them via API keys. We’ve previously seen Arduino release their Claude-based Arduino Cloud Editor, which runs in the browser for context-aware coding assistance. But the problem with that is, if you don’t have internet, you can’t use the IDE. Embedr runs locally and uses Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM, meaning you can compile and debug your code offline without needing a constant internet connection. Additionally, Embedr gives you greater control and privacy compared to [...]</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>There are already many cheap ESP32 drones on AliExpress, or you can even make an ESP32 DIY drone for about $12, but 01Studio&#8217;s pyDrone is a little different as it&#8217;s based on an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module and runs MicroPython firmware instead of the ESP32-Drone firmware. The pyDrone can be controlled over WiFi or Bluetooth using the pyController gamepad, also based on the same ESP32-S3 module. Another advantage of the pyDrone is that it comes with a connector for the OV2640 camera module that&#8217;s often missing in other low-cost ESP32 drones. pyDrone specifications: Wireless Module &#8211; ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 SoC – ESP32-S3N8R8 CPU &#8211; Dual-core Tensilica LX7 up to 240 MHz RAM &#8211; 512KB SRAM, up to 8MB PSRAM Storage &#8211; 8MB flash Wireless – WiFi 4 and Bluetooth LE 5 Antenna &#8211; PCB antenna Motors &#8211; 4x 716 hollow cup motors Blades &#8211; 46mm propeller blades Flight range WiFi &#8211; 120 meters Bluetooth [...]</p>

<p>SunFounder has sent me a review sample of the Pironman 5 Max Tower PC case for the Raspberry Pi 5 SBC. We had already reviewed the Pironman 5 last year, but the new Max model has various improvements, including a sleeker design made of black aluminum and semi-transparent black acrylic panels, a dual NVMe PiP expansion board for two M.2 NVMe SSDs (optionally in RAID 0/1 configuration), or one NVMe SSD and one AI accelerator module, a Tap-to-Wake feature for the OLED information display, and programmable RGB LEDs for the two fans. So the Pironman 5 Max deserves another review of its own.  I&#8217;ll be doing an unboxing, going through the assembly instructions and software installation, before testing the new features, and finally, the cooling efficiency of the solution.

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>
