<p>NAS used to store your files in your local network for easy access, but new models like QNAP TS-216G, TS-AI642, and TS-133 feature an Arm processor (Rockchip RK3566 or RK3588) with a built-in NPU to accelerate image recognition, so that users can find their photos with a simple text search like &#8220;Disneyland Mickey Mouse&#8221;. However, if you own an older NAS that lacks an AI accelerator, QNAP has launched the QAI-M100 (M.2 2280) and QAI-U100 (USB) equipped with a Rockchip RK1808 3 TOPS AI accelerator designed to speed up image and facial recognition by up to 36%.

<p>We&#8217;ve been sent the OMBAR DC42 Dash Cam for review. It&#8217;s a car dash cam kit with a 4K UHD front camera and a 1080p FHD rear camera, each with a wide F1.8 aperture that allows more light for clear images day and night. The kit ships with a 64GB microSD card and supports cards with up to 256GB capacity. The distraction-free, screenless camera supports dual-band (2.4 + 5GHz) WiFi connectivity, GPS location recording to show driving routes, voice guidance, and in-car audio recording. The dash cam also includes accident detection with a G-sensor and a 24-hour parking mode, but the latter requires the optional OMBAR 3-lead hard-wire kit, which sadly was not included in our kit. In this review, we will start with the specifications of the OMBAR 42 dash car, go through an unboxing, report our experience installing the cameras in our car (spoiler: it&#8217;s much easier than [...]</p>

<p>While Meshtastic is by far the most popular off-grid messaging solution relying on LoRa radios, MeshCore offers an alternative as a lightweight C++ library and firmware designed for multi-hop packet routing and made for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet. The project&#8217;s GitHub repository provides some high-level differences compared to the Meshtastic and Reticulum projects: MeshCore provides the ability to create wireless mesh networks, similar to Meshtastic and Reticulum but with a focus on lightweight multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects. Unlike Meshtastic, which is tailored for casual LoRa communication, or Reticulum, which offers advanced networking, MeshCore balances simplicity with scalability, making it ideal for custom embedded solutions., where devices (nodes) can communicate over long distances by relaying messages through intermediate nodes. This is especially useful in off-grid, emergency, or tactical situations where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable. MeshCore key features: Multi-hop [...]</p>

<p>While searching Aliexpress for new products, I found out about the JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV from the Maker Go AliExpress store, another ESP32-P4 development board with features very similar to the  ESP32-P4-Function-EV-Board or the Wireless Tag WT99P4C5-S1 board, but built around the GUITION JC-ESP32P4-M3-C6 module, which combines ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C6 into a single package instead of having separate chips or modules on most other designs. Features include 32MB of PSRAM and 16MB of flash on the GUITION module, a microSD card slot for storage, a built-in microphone, speaker output via the ES8311 audio codec, and an audio amplifier. The board also offers a 10/100Mbps Ethernet RJ45 port, an RS-485 terminal block, a GPIO header, and expansion connectors for both the ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C6 chips. Additionally, there are three USB ports: two USB-C and one USB-A for power, data, and debugging, along with a few buttons and LEDs.

<p>USB-to-serial debug boards are commonly used for board bring-up, checking for issues when a board does not boot, or accessing the serial console in systems without networking or video output. You&#8217;d just connect GND, Tx, and Rx wires to the target board, and a USB cable to the host, before running a terminal program like Putty, Minicom, or Bootterm with the correct parameters, and you should be good to go. That&#8217;s the theory, but sometimes Tx and Rx may be inverted, the baudrate is not advertised, and so on. So Excamera Labs decided to make the TermDriver 2, an improved USB-to-serial with a small built-in display to more easily debug those issues. It can also be used in standalone mode, showing the serial console output on the tiny screen without having to connect it to a host. TermDriver 2 specifications: MCU &#8211; Raspberry Pi RP2040 dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ MCU @ [...]</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p></div>
