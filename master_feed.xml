<p>Mekotronics R58-4&#215;4 3U is yet another device based on Rockchip RK3588 from the company, but this product is a 4K video encoder with four SDI inputs, and four SDI loop outputs mirroring the SDI inputs. SDI (Serial Digital Interface) inputs are used for transmitting uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals and typically found in professional video production and broadcasting environments. The SDI interface can also be found in security cameras like the MOKOSE SHD50-2.8-12MM and I can also see it used in cameras designed for live streaming on YouTube, or other services. The main advantages of SDI over interfaces like USB, HDMI, or Ethernet, are that it can use longer cables up to 300 meters, offers better signal integrity, and has near zero latency. Compatibility for professional camera equipment is another advantage. Let&#8217;s look at the Mekotronics R58-4&#215;4 3U specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3588 octa-core processor with CPU – 4x CortexA76  [...]</p>

<p>Some Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 are now available in the industrial/extended temperature operating from -40°C to +85°C, suitable for outdoor applications in cold climates and (some) cold storage solutions that require sub -20°C temperature. When the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 was launched in 2020, Raspberry Pi did not provide an operating temperature range. Since then, the Raspberry CM4 has been qualified to operate in the -20°C to +85°C range, which is suitable for most applications but not all. Eben Upton has now announced the availability of Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 variants with extended temperature range.

<p>Espressif ESP32-C2 (ESP8684) has been updated to v2.0 with 20 KB of additional SRAM, 100 KB of extra flash, with some improvements in terms of erase and program performance. The ESP32-C2 was first unveiled in April 2024 with limited details, and launched in October of the same year as the ESP8684 SiP combining ESP32-C2 die with 4MB flash, as well as a few ESP8684 modules and the ESP8684-DevKitM-1 development board. The ESP32-C2 is meant to be a cost-down version of the ESP32-C3 with less RAM and peripherals, and the ESP32-C2 v2.0 slightly improved on that with parts adding X to the name: ESP8684H2X (2MB flash) and ESP8684H4X (4MB flash). Modules and devkit names are also impacted, albeit not shown yet in the screenshot below. The part names had to be updated because chip revision v2.0 and previous chip revisions are not software-compatible, so Espressif had to update the ordering codes [...]</p>

<p>When the Orion O6 mini-ITX motherboard with a CIX P1 12-core Armv9 SoC was announced in December 2024, we were told binary releases would start on January 15, 2025, and the source code would be released later in Q1 2025. Tom Cubie further explained that upstreaming of the CIX kernel would start in Q2 of 2025, and Linux 6.1 with Device Tree plus Linux 6.6 with ACPI would be supported in the meantime. I&#8217;ve been able to quickly check the Debian 12 binary release on the Orion O6 motherboard at the end of January, but as I was looking for an updated image for the second part of the review, I noticed there weren&#8217;t any new Debian 12 images so far.

<p>Belgium-company Citronics has designed a router based on the mainboard of the Fairphone 2 smartphone, connecting the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 &#8220;system-on-module&#8221; to a carrier board with Ethernet, USB ports, and other connectors, while leveraging 4G LTE, WiFi, and Bluetooth connectivity from the phone&#8217;s core board. Citronics calls this type of hardware &#8220;Circular Microcomputers,&#8221; which refers to small computers focusing on sustainability and circular economy principles using parts from discarded devices like old smartphones. There&#8217;s actually more than one router, as Citronics designed its own development kit, and also partnered with other companies to design custom gateways based on the Fairphone 2 mainboard. Let&#8217;s have a look at the devkit first.

<p>Tropic Square TROPIC01 is an auditable, open architecture, tamper-proof RISC-V based secure element (SE) designed to interface with microcontrollers in products such as hardware wallets, authentication solutions, biometric wallets, medical devices, and other IoT solutions. There are plenty of secure elements on the market, but their design is usually closed-source, so the design can&#8217;t be easily verified by third parties and flaws may remain hidden even when discovered.  With its open designs, potentially flaws in the TROPIC01 can easily be found, disclosed, and fixed by the community, and such verifiable design improved trust in the security of the solution.

<p>Most products based on Raspberry Pi CM5 make use of the eMMC flash version, but Giada DN25 fanless 4K digital signage player relies on the Raspberry Pi CM5 Lite module instead, but still uses 32GB or 64GB flash. This looks like a contradiction at first since the CM5 Lite module has no eMMC flash, but more on that later. The media player uses a CM5 Lite module with 2GB RAM and a wireless module, and features two full HDMI ports to drive up to two 4K displays, a 3.5mm audio jack, a Gigabit Ethernet port, four USB ports, and an RS232 port for peripheral connection (e.g. barcode scanner).

<p>Nvidia GPUs have been running fine on Arm for a while now—I just upgraded the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">System76 Thelio Astra</a> to an RTX 4080 Super and am testing it now.</p>

<p>But Nvidia seems to have a partnership with Ampere, which probably leads to their drivers getting priority support, and likely a few special edge cases in code to work around a couple PCIe quirks on the Altra CPUs. Nvidia <em>also</em> builds their own Arm CPUs—a <em>lot</em> of them—so Arm support is definitely a priority for them.</p>

<p>Designed by Hartmut Graw, the LispDeck is a Handheld Lisp computer built around the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller for Lisp programming on the go. It features a dual-screen setup with a 5-inch touchscreen and, a secondary ST77350-based TFT display. It also has an Adafruit RFM96 radio module, an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module, a rotary encoder, an SD card for storage, and a detachable wireless USB keyboard, all housed in a 3D-printed case. Running the uLisp language, it features a standalone Lisp programming environment without needing a PC or tablet. It is an evolution of the LispBox, with a portable and battery-powered design, which also maintains compatibility.

<p>The Haasoscope Pro is an open-source hardware, high-bandwidth, and real-time sampling USB oscilloscope. Building upon its predecessor, the Haasoscope, the new Pro model offers a bandwidth of 2GHz, 12-bit resolution, and a 3.2GS/s sampling rate. The Haasoscope Pro USB oscilloscope is “designed to be low cost, while maintaining super-fast performance.” While it only comes with 2 channels, the flexible design makes it possible to combine and sync multiple devices (using Cat5 cables) to double the sample rate or add more channels. The oscilloscope works with standard x10 passive probes but a custom active probe, the Haasoscope Pro-be, is also offered. It supports the full 2GHz analog bandwidth and is priced much cheaper than similar probes. The Haasoscope Pro USB oscilloscope’s high sampling rate and bandwidth make it ideal for radio frequency signal analysis and high-speed digital debugging. It is similar to the ThunderScope Thunderbolt and PCIe oscilloscope which offers more [...]</p>

<p>Waveshare has recently launched the PCIe TO PCIe x1 Board (C) which is a PCIe FFC connector to standard PCIe x1 slot adapter board for the Raspberry Pi 5. But while searching for more details about the board, I also found out about other solutions from 52Pi and Spotpear, which are a bit older, but still worth taking a look because of their unique features and low cost. These Raspberry Pi PCIe x1 slot adapters allow users to connect expansion cards such as network cards, storage controllers, and other PCIe peripherals to the Raspberry Pi 5. Additionally, the board features a dedicated 12V power header and DC jack, which supplies power to the 12V pins of the PCIe slot, for power-hungry devices. These features allow for applications like AI acceleration, high-speed networking, and storage expansion. Waveshare PCIe TO PCIe x1 Board (C) The Waveshare PCIe FFC to PCIe x1 Adapter [...]</p>

<p>Arm Cortex-A320 is a low-power Armv9 CPU core optimized for Edge AI and IoT applications, with up to 50% efficiency improvements over the Cortex-A520 CPU core. It is the smallest Armv9 core unveiled so far. The Armv9 architecture was first introduced in 2021 with a focus on AI and specialized cores, followed by the first Armv9 cores &#8211; Cortex-A510, Cortex-A710, Cortex-X2 &#8211; unveiled later that year and targeting flagship mobile devices. Since then we&#8217;ve seen Armv9 cores on a wider range of smartphones, high-end Armv9 motherboards, and TV boxes, The upcoming Rockchip RK3688 AIoT SoC also features Armv9 but targets high-end applications. The new Arm Cortex-A320 will expand Armv9 usage to a much wider range of IoT devices including power-constrained Edge AI devices.

<p>Like the wearable voice-activated assistants last year (Rabbit R1 and Humane AI), smart glasses have become quite trendy and will likely be the most popular AI-enabled form factor this year. The Halliday smart glasses are a pair of AI-enabled smart glasses with an invisible display and a proactive assistant that “helps before you ask”. The Halliday smart glasses integrate a small display module into the frame, unlike the Loomos and Looktech smart glasses launched earlier this year through crowdfunding campaigns. The display module, DigiWindow, is described as “the world’s smallest display module at 3.5mm” and invisible to onlookers. It uses a monochrome green MicroLED with projection optics to allow users to access information without obstructing their field of view. The Halliday proactive AI smart glasses come in a lightweight frame, weighing only 35 grams. They can be controlled by voice, the included controller ring, a rapid button for shortcuts, or [...]</p>

<p>Last December, Debashis wrote about the Waveshare Double Eye LCD module comprised of two round displays that can be useful for robotics or art projects since they can be made to look like googly eyes. The module is designed to be connected to a host MCU via an SPI interface. The TouchEye looks similar but offers larger 1.28-inch round displays (instead of 0.71-inch),  and also adds a touch function. Instead of being connected to a host MCU via SPI like the Waveshare model, the TouchEye dual touch display module is a complete board with an onboard MCU that can be either a Raspberry Pi RP2040 or an Espressif ESP32-S3 that also offers WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. Both boards also feature a USB-C port for power and programming, a microSD card slot, a GPIO breakout connector, and programmable buttons.

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.</p>

<p>Handling power outages is never a top priority... until it's the <em>only</em> priority! And by then it's usually too late! Luckily for me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.</p>

<p>This week the power company emailed and said they'd be cutting power for maintenance next week, but they don't have an exact time. So it's even more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!</p>

<p>ESPNowCam is an open-source library for ESP32 camera boards that relies on the ESP-NOW protocol for efficient point-to-point, one-to-many, or many-to-one video or data transmission. ESP32 microcontrollers already support WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity, but the ESP-NOW offers an alternative in scenarios where low latency is required and/or access to a router is not feasible or practical. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve previously seen ESPNOW used in ESP32 drones. As its name implies, the ESPNowCam project leverages the ESP_NOW wireless protocol for ESP32 video cameras, but can also be used for data transmission. ESPNowCam highlights: Transmission modes One transmitter to multiple receivers using the internal ESPNow broadcasting feature (1:N mode) Peer-to-peer (P2P) connections utilizing MAC address targeting (1:1 mode) Multi-sender mode with one receiver (N:1 mode) No need for IPs, routers, or credentials The project was first released in January 2024, but I&#8217;ve only noticed it, and it had several iterations since then.

            <p>Recently, I've been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647">Radxa's Dual 2.5G Router HAT</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using <em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>'s <code>--bind</code> option (like <code>--bind [ip address of interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces—it would just route all traffic through one!</p>

<p>Luckily, I found the issue <a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, @bmah888 mentioned the <code>--bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.</p>

<p>Using that option (like <code>--bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3 -s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both connections as much as the Pi will allow:</p>

            <p></p>

<p>SiFive's <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">HiFive Premier P550</a> is a strange board. It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've tested—though I haven't tested a <a href="https://milkv.io/pioneer">Milk-V Jupiter</a>. It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>

            <p>RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I'm in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.</p>

<p>From my first tests on the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive 2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth, fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.</p>

<p>The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn't have a <em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including llama.cpp and Ollama!</p>

<h2>Compiling Ollama for RISC-V Linux</h2>

<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running Ollama's simple install script, I get:</p>
