<p>While child-sized humanoid robots like the Unitree R1 have come down in price, not everybody has a spare $6,000 to throw around to play with robots, and smaller models like the Tonybot are more affordable for educational purposes. The Tonybot offers 17 degrees of freedom, relies on high-voltage bus servos and anti-blockage servos, and has a separate ESP32 expansion board for extra modules. Optionally equipped with an ESP32-S3 AI vision camera and an AI voice integration module, the 38cm tall humanoid robot supports object and face recognition, color and line following tracking, human-robot interaction, fall recovery, obstacle avoidance, and more, besides walking, dancing, etc&#8230; Tonybot specifications: H5S Robot Controller Storage &#8211; MicroSD card socket 6x servo ports, head module port Bluetooth/MP3 module header Sensor &#8211; Accelerometer Debugging &#8211; 4-pin UART header Misc ON/OFF switch Buzzer Power Supply Via DC jack Terminal block for battery ESP32 Expansion Board ESP32-DevKitC board PWM [...]</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just written about Will Whang’s RPI5-SDexpress-Hat board, which adds a microSD Express slot to the Raspberry Pi 5, but it&#8217;s not that small, and it&#8217;s using the 40-pin GPIO for power, so it&#8217;s not convenient if you want to install another Raspberry Pi HAT+. Vassily Petrov&#8217;s &#8220;microSD-express Pi Adapter&#8221; is a much smaller microSD Express adapter on a flexible PCB that plugs directly into the PCIe FFC connector and nothing else, driving power from the PCIe connector only. There&#8217;s not much on the PCB itself besides a microSD Express card slot and a Microchip MIC2230 800mA/800mA step-down DC/DC regulator.  We&#8217;re told speeds of up to 800 MB/s are achievable, limited by the PCIe Gen3 x1 interface on the Pi 5 itself. For reference, the RPI5-SDexpress-Hat was tested at about 600 MB/s for sequential reads and under 200MB/s for sequential writes using a 256GB Samsung microSD Express card. A worry [...]</p>

<p>THIRDREALITY Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1 may look like a traditional mechanical keyboard, but it supports the Matter protocol to double as a Smart Home controller. I initially thought it was a ridiculous idea, but as someone who spends 8 hours or more a day in front of a keyboard, it could be quite convenient. Simply press the F1 to F12 keys to control lights, adjust air conditioners, smart shades, and more with minimal distraction. So let&#8217;s have a look at the MK1 in more detail. Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1 specifications: Model Number &#8211; 3RMK01069M Wireless connectivity Matter over Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz only, 5GHz not supported) Compatible Devices &#8211; Apple Home, Home Assistant, SmartThings, and Google Home (and likely other Matter-certified hubs with Wi-Fi connectivity) Likely based on Bouffalo Lab BL602 chip (See Home Assistant screenshot below).

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>The Raspberry Pi RP2350 dual-core Arm/RISC-V has gotten a new version &#8211; A4 stepping &#8211; addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities, notably the infamous E9 GPIO erratum and glitching bugs in the A2 stepping identified by the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Both RP2350A and RP2350B variants will benefit from the new stepping and be marked RP2350A0A4 and RP2350B0A4, respectively. The company also announced the availability of the 2MB flash variants, the RP2354A and RP2354B (unveiled in March 2025), that do not require flash on the board. RP2350 A4 stepping highlights: Fixes Glitching bugs identified in the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Exploits required physical access to the chip. The E9 GPIO erratum related to GPIO pull-ups. A4 stepping is a drop-in replacement for the earlier A2 stepping. 5V-tolerant GPIOs; Note: the chip must remain powered while 5V IOs are used (See updated datasheet for details) RP2354A and RP2354B variants with 2MB of stacked-in-package QSPI [...]</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.16 on LKML: It&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, and the release cycle has come to an end. Last week was nice and calm, and there were no big show-stopper surprises to keep us from the regular schedule, so I&#8217;ve tagged and pushed out 6.16 as planned. It&#8217;s worth noting that the upcoming merge window for 6.17 is going to be slightly chaotic for me: I have multiple family events this August (a wedding and a big birthday), and with said family being spread not only across the US, but in Finland too, I&#8217;m spending about half the month traveling. That means that I will try very hard to get most of the merge window done the first week before my travels start, and I already ended upgiving a heads-up on that to the people who tend to send me the most pull requests.

<p>Will Whang&#8217;s RPI5-SDexpress-Hat is a small HAT+ for the Raspberry Pi 5, adding a microSD Express card slot for ultrafast storage, an eject button, and two Qwiic connectors, probably because there was still some spare space on the board&#8230; As a reminder, microSD Express cards can deliver SSD performance thanks to the use of of PCIe interface and NVMe commands. The standard was first introduced in 2019, and even earlier (2018) for full-size SD cards, but manufacturers have not exactly rushed to release compatible hardware. A major change this year is the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 portable game console, one of the first mass market devices with a microSD Express slot, and this was partially why Will created the microSD Express HAT+ for the Raspberry Pi 5.

<p>Arduino has shrunk the UNO R4 with the Arduino Nano R4 board equipped with the same 48 MHz Renesas RA4M1 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4F microcontroller, but offered in a much more compact form factor. It&#8217;s closer to the UNO R4 Minima in terms of functionality, since it lacks the ESP32 wireless module and LED matrix found in the UNO R4 WiFi board. The new Nano R4 still features a USB-C port, an I2C Qwiic connector, and two 15-pin GPIO headers with castellated holes for expansion. Arduino Nano R4 specifications: Microcontroller – Renesas RA4M1 Arm Cortex-M4F MCU @ 48 MHz with 32KB SRAM, 256KB flash, 8KB EEPROM USB – 1 x USB Type-C port for power and programming Expansion 2x 15-pin GPIO headers 21x digital I/Os Analog 8x 14-bit analog input pins, 1x Op Amp using A1, A2, and A3 pins 12-bit analog DAC 6x PWM 1x UART, 1x I2C (5V), 1x [...]</p>

<p>&#8220;xcrhom WLED Type-C&#8221; is a tiny ESP32 board designed to run WLED open-source firmware that supports WS2812(B) RGB LED strips. It also supports audio-reactive effects using an &#8220;external microphone&#8221;, which appears to mean the microphone on the smartphone running the WLED app, more on that later. We had already written about other small ESP32/ESP32-S3-based WLED controllers with the likes of Adafruit Sparkle Motion Stick and ANAVI Miracle Emitter, and the xchhom board&#8217;s main selling point is its price, as it goes for about $12 before taxes (AliExpress even shows me a $6.14 &#8220;Welcome offer&#8221; including shipping). xchome WLED Type-C board specifications: Wireless module – ESP32-WROOM-32D SoC – Espressif ESP32-D0WD dual-core Tensilica LX6 processor @ 240 MHz Storage – 32Mbit SPI flash Connectivity – Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n up to 150 Mbps, Bluetooth 4.2/5.x LE IPEX antenna connector (antenna provided) RGB LED support 3-pin connector with GND, DA (Data), and 5V signals [...]</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve just written about the Ugoos X5M Pro as one of the first Amlogic S905X5M TV boxes, but the market is expanding, and Xiaomi TV Stick 4K (2nd Gen) Google TV dongle is now available as a smaller version of the company&#8217;s Xiaomi TV Box S (3rd Gen) based on the same or similar processor. The TV stick features 2GB RAM, 8GB eMMC flash, a 4K-capable HDMI male port, and WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, and not much else, as one would expect from an HDMI TV stick. It ships with a Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant voice commands. The company did not list the exact part number of the processor, and while it matches the Amlogic S905X5M specifications, it should be another model without Ethernet support, like Amlogic did in the past with the S905Y4, so maybe an S905Y5M?

<p>Diabolic Parasite is an ESP32-S3-based USB dongle for penetration testing and security research. It supports keystroke injection, keylogging, wireless access, and detection-evasion. Its functionality looks similar to the earlier Diabolic Drive from &#8220;UNIT 72784&#8221; with an ATMega24 + ESP8266 design and 64GB eMMC flash, but the Parasite is instead based on an ESP32-S3 chip with only 8MB flash and no eMMC flash. Diabolic Parasite specifications: Wireless SoC &#8211; Espressif Systems ESP32-S3FN8 CPU – Xtensa Dual-core 32-bit LX7 Microprocessor with up to 240MHz clock speed Memory – 512KB SRAM, Storage – 384KB ROM, 8MB SPI flash Wireless – Wi-Fi 4 and Bluetooth 5.0 with BLE Antenna &#8211; High-gain 4.1 dBi, 2.4 GHz ceramic chip antenna USB USB Type-A male port for host connectivity USB Type-A female port for passthrough and device communication Features Keystroke Reflection Exfiltration Keylogger Functionality Wireless Control USB passthrough Multi-HID Device Handling: keyboard and mouse emulation with input [...]</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>But it's not just self-hosting.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>
