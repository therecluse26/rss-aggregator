<p>Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ and W5 Gen 2 are new wearable platforms adding NB-NTN satellite support for emergencies to the Snapdragon W5+/W5 wearable platforms introduced in 2022, and found in various WearOS smartwatches and the Beacon W5 SoM. The W5+/W5 Gen 2 platforms still feature a 1.7 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 processor, an Adreno A702 GPU, an AON QCC5100 ML co-processor (W5+ Gen 2 only), MIPI DSI and MIPI CSI interfaces, cellular connectivity, dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 5.3, GNSS, and optional NFC support. The main changes are NB-NTN support, an upgrade to 3GPP Rel 17 with Cat 1Bis, a 20% (or 30% depending on where you read) smaller RF frontend, and 50% more accurate GPS in urban or deep canyon areas. Snapdragon W5+/W5 Gen 2 specifications: SWS5100 SoC CPU – Quad-core Cortex-A53 processor @ up to 1.7 GHz GPU – Qualcomm Adreno A702 @ up to 1 GHz with OpenGL ES 3.1 API [...]</p>

<p>Waveshare ESP32-P4-ETH is a compact ESP32-P4 development board with Ethernet and PoE support, which looks very similar to the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit minus the pUEXT connector. However, we&#8217;ve also covered other ESP32-P4 boards with Ethernet (and other features) such as the ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT, the ESP32-P4-NANO board, and the GUITION JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV. Design wise, the board also looks very similar to the Wiznet boards based on Raspberry Pi RP2xxx microcontroller such as the W55RP20-EVB-Pico, the W6300-EVB-Pico2, and the W5100S-EVB-Pico2 boards, but you can also run multimedia workloads with MIPI camera and display interfaces, hardware video encoding, audio processing, AI speech functions, and advanced security features on the ESP32-P4-ETH board.

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve just come across a no-name non-contact, high-precision 80 GHz mmWave radar sensor for liquid level detection with a 40m range, ±5mm accuracy, and Modbus communication over UART. We had seen 24 GHz and 60 GHz mmWave sensors mostly for precise motion detection, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen an 80 GHz mmWave sensor, or more exactly, 79 GHz. It operates on the same principle of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar as most other mmWave sensors and connects to an Arduino or other board over UART.

<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) released the Matter 1.4 specification in fall 2024, and we skipped Matter 1.4.1 here, but decided to cover the Matter 1.4.2 release, which enables WiFi only provisioning, removing the need for a Bluetooth LE radio often only used for onboarding Smart Home devices. This will enable device makers to reduce costs and hardware complexity by removing the Bluetooth LE radio and the associated software stack in designs where a BLE radio is only used solely for commissioning. While Matter 1.4.2 is a minor dot release, it includes many other changes we&#8217;ll cover below. Matter 1.4.2 highlights: Wi-Fi Only Commissioning &#8211;  Relies on Wi-Fi Unsynchronized Service Discovery (USD), and removes the need for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radios to onboard devices to the Matter ecosystems.

<p>Raspberry Pi introduced the 7-inch Touch Display 2 with 1280&#215;720 resolution and a thinner design last November. The company has now introduced a 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 that sells for $40 instead of $60 for the 7-inch model. Besides the smaller dimensions, nothing much else changed, as the 5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 keeps the same 1280&#215;720 resolution, 5-point multi-touch capacitive support, 24-bit RGB format, and so on. One difference is the viewing angle: 80° for the new 5-inch model, and 85° for the 7-inch variant.

<p>When RUIPRO asked me to review an HDMI cable, I almost immediately deleted their email. After all, who wants to review a dumb HDMI cable? But I still took a look and noticed that their cable used optical fiber, and they sold HDMI cables up to 300 meters long on Amazon.  My longest HDMI cable is about 1.5 meters long, so I got intrigued and asked for a 100-foot (30-meter) fiber HDMI cable for testing. RUIPRO fiber HDMI cable unboxing When I received the parcel, I got two boxes, so I thought there might be a receiver and a transmitter. But no, they must like me and sent two &#8220;8K detachable pure fiber HDMI cables&#8221;.

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest port by Erik Wierich, Senior Engineer at RISCstar Solutions, demonstrating a practical security implementation for embedded devices using standard Linux tools like dm-verity and TPM 2.0. It covers threat models, filesystem security, and TPM-based encryption with working code examples. Nowadays, it is (rightfully) impossible to put an embedded device into the market without comprehensive embedded device security measures. Most new devices store private data that we do not want to see leaked in dark corners of the Internet. We also want to avoid our device ending up as part of a botnet. Linux has a large set of tools to help us with security. What has historically been lacking is a simple, off-the-shelf way to integrate these tools into a secure-by-default configuration. This post will demonstrate how modern tools simplify deployments while ensuring strong security. Embedded Device Security Scope When talking about embedded system security, [...]</p>

<p>If you found the Pironman 5 and Pironman 5 Max Tower PC cases for the Raspberry Pi 5 pretty cool, but had a hard time justifying paying much more for the enclosure than for the board itself, SunFounder has an update for you. The company has now introduced the Pironman 5 Mini Tower PC enclosure with a similar, yet smaller design, fewer features, and easier assembly, bringing the price down to $45.99. That means the OLED information display, most RGB LEDs, the oversized tower cooler, the micro HDMI to HDMI adapter board, and more are all gone.

<p>In the past, we have seen various consumer-grade Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based robot dogs like the Petoi Bittle and XGO 2, as well as the XGO Mini Pro built around the Kendryte K210/K510 AI processor. Waveshare has launched another option. WAVEGO Pro is a 12-DOF bionic quadruped (robot dog) with dual ESP32/Raspberry Pi control, real-time feedback servos, a 5MP ultra-wide camera, and an open-source web-based control interface. The ESP32 sub-controller handles all real-time, low-level motion control tasks, wireless connectivity, and the optional Raspberry Pi 4B/5 host controller handles higher-level functions such as OpenCV vision processing, AI-driven decision-making, and advanced control logic. The robot uses 2.3 kg·cm serial bus servos, and the chassis is built using 5052 aluminum alloy and PA12 nylon structure with 40 bearing joints for smooth, reliable movement. For self-balancing, this robot dog has a 9-axis IMU, and for other controls, it includes ESP-NOW host–sub mode, JSON task-file [...]</p>

<p>Arm neural technology will add dedicated neural/AI accelerators to Arm GPUs launched in 2026 and beyond to deliver up to 50% GPU workload reduction for mobile games and other graphics-intensive apps. The first application is called Arm Neural Super Sampling (NSS). It&#8217;s a kind of AI Super Resolution implementation for games, where rather than upscaling videos, the AI accelerator upscales graphics to lower the required bandwidth and increase the frame rate (or lower the power consumption) with no impact on the rendering quality. Watch the video below to see a demo rendered at 540p resolution by the GPU and upscaled to 1080p resolution by Arm neural technology with no obvious defects. The upscaler will introduce some lag, but only about 4ms per frame in sustained performance conditions, as explained in a technical blog about the Arm Neural and NSS announcement: We assume a target of 10 TOP/s per-watt of neural acceleration [...]</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>
