<p>The BentoIO CMX1 is a compact, low-profile Raspberry Pi CM5 carrier board, developed by Terioto in Germany. With an 85 x 85 mm footprint and a height of just 11 mm, it&#8217;s designed for space-constrained applications like embedded systems, industrial control, and compact edge devices. After the official launch of the Raspberry Pi CM5 module and its carrier board, we’ve seen boards like Waveshare CM5-NANO-B and Orange Pi CM5 “Tablet” Base Board get released. There is no doubt that they are compact, but they are not as slim as this board. While it&#8217;s slim, that doesn’t mean it lacks I/Os; it includes a 40-pin Raspberry Pi-compatible GPIO header, two USB 3.0 ports, two internal USB 2.0 headers, a MIPI DSI  connector and an optional HDMI port for video output, optional gigabit Ethernet, a PCIe M.2 M-Key for expansion, and it uses a USB-C for power. Other features include an RTC battery connector, [...]</p>

<p>MicroSui (Sui Embedded Framework) is a lightweight, modular, open-source C framework that brings the Sui Network to microcontrollers from low-end 8-bit MCUs like AVR to more powerful 32-bit SoCs like the ESP32. Wait&#8230; What&#8217;s the Sui Network / Protocol exactly? It&#8217;s a blockchain platform designed for high-speed, scalable, and low-cost decentralized applications, which was introduced in May 2023 by Mysten Labs, a company founded by former Meta engineers. It competes with networks like Solana and Ethereum but with better performance. So far, the Sui Network works with web and mobile applications, but MicroSui aims to expand its usage to resource-constrained embedded devices. We&#8217;re told MicroSui provides support for all core operations such as key management, transaction construction, signing, and broadcast. It is a pure-C library with no OS dependency or dynamic memory usage, so it can be deployed on a wide range of microcontrollers. Higher-end microcontrollers with Internet access, such [...]</p>

<p>The PCIe 7.0 specification has been released, offering a data rate of up to 128GT/s, or a bi-directional transfer rate of 512GB/s in x16 configuration. This doubles the speed of PCIe 6.0 specification released in 2022, reaching up to 64GT/s data rate, or 256GB/s bi-directional transfer rates. PCI-SIG says the PCIe 7.0 specification targets data-intensive applications such as AI/ML, 800 Gbps Ethernet, cloud, and Quantum computing. Work on PCIe 8.0 has started, likely aiming for 256GT/s and a 2028 release date. Like PCIe 6.0, PCIe 7.0 utilizes PAM4 (Pulse Amplitude Modulation with 4 levels) signaling and Flit-based encoding. It also provides improved power efficiency and maintains backwards compatibility with previous generations of PCIe technology. New specifications are released regularly, and since the introduction of PCI in 1992 with a 013GB/s data rate, the PCI/PCIe bandwidth has roughly doubled every three years, as illustrated in the chart below.

<p>The SD Association released the SD 7.1 standard with support for cards compliant with the microSD Express standard, enabling SSD-like performance on microSD cards by using a PCIe/NVMe interface, and more recent updates to the standard even enable speeds of up to 2GB/s. Saying that adoption has been slow would be an understatement, but things have changed recently, thanks to the introduction of the Nintendo Switch 2 portable game console, the first mainstream device to support the new standard. NVNT has had fun with it by designing a microSD Express to M.2 NVMe adapter (SDEX2M2) for the Nintendo Switch 2 or other devices supporting the microSD Express standard. The board design is pretty simple because it simply routes the PCIe signals from an M.2 NVMe 2230 SSD to the microSD Express connector. Three components can be found on the board: an M.2 2230 M-socket, a 220Ω ferrite bead, and an [...]</p>

<p>We have received a review sample of an energy metering device from SeeedStudio called the XIAO 2-Channel Wi-Fi AC Energy Meter (XIAO-2CH-EM). This device uses a clamp-on CT (Current Transformer) method on the live wire that you want to measure, without needing to modify the existing electrical wiring. XIAO-2CH-EM comes with several key features such as dual CT sensors (CT1 and CT2), native ESPHome &#38; Home Assistant Integration, precise measurement with factory calibration, and bi-directional power flow monitoring. While the XIAO-2CH-EM has 2 CT input ports, it will only ship with one CT clamp by default, but users can purchase an additional CT clamp if needed. The two CT channels operate independently, and each one can measure bidirectional power and supports devices using up to 100A of current. That should be enough for an ordinary home. The XIAO-2CH-EM comes pre-flashed with ESPHome firmware from the factory, meaning it can be [...]</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen x86 mini PCs for under $100 a few times, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen one going for under $50, and that&#8217;s exactly what the Wo-we HU-MNPC05-L mini PC has to offer as the system is sold for $44.99 on Amazon with an old Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core Gemini Lake Refresh processor first introduced in 2019. What&#8217;s even more surprising is that it&#8217;s not a barebone model like cheaper mini PCs usually are, but it ships with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB eMMC flash. No sane person would likely attempt to use the thing as a Windows Desktop, but it may be an option for Linux distributions for workloads similar to what you would typically run on a Raspberry Pi 4/5, or for older Windows applications, or as a basic HTPC.

<p>Jetway PIC-ASL1 is a low-power, fanless Pico-ITX SBC built around the Intel Atom x7213RE or x7433RE Amston Lake SoC for industrial use. This SBC is very similar to the Alder Lake-N-based JPIC-ADN1, which Jetway released just last year. While both boards support up to 32GB DDR5 memory and dual displays via HDMI 2.0b and LVDS/eDP, the PIC-ASL1 adds industrial-grade resilience with shock/vibration resistance, a Nano SIM slot for cellular connectivity, and an Intel PTT for security. It also features a similar I/O layout, including dual USB 3.2 Gen 2, four USB 2.0, serial headers, two M.2 expansion slots, and a SATA III port for storage. Additionally, the PIC-ASL1 complies with various industrial standards, making it more suitable for use in harsh industrial environments compared to the ADN1.

<p>Colonel Panic&#8217;s Mesh Mapper is a project designed to map drones emitting the FAA&#8217;s Remote ID over WiFi or Bluetooth with location, altitude, pilot position, and identification data. This project utilizes an ESP32-C3 or ESP32-S3 to capture Remote ID transmissions within range, and then feeds the data into a Python Flask web application part of Mesh Mapper that provides real-time visualization and logging.  Meshtastic allows multiple detection nodes to share information across a mesh network, so several ESP32 nodes can be deployed in an area and be alerted when drones fly within your property or neighborhood. While you could use your own ESP32-C3/S3 board and Meshtastic hardware for this project, Colonel Panic designed a breakout board for XIAO ESP32C3 or ESP32S3 WiFi &#38; Bluetooth module and Heltec LoRa 32 V3 connected over serial to make things easier.

<p>D&#38;MP Vortex86EX3 is a Twin Core x86 SoC for industrial applications with a master CPU and a Slave CPU,  each capable of running an operating system independently, be it Windows 10 IoT, Linux, legacy OS like WinCE or DOS, or an RTOS like QNX. Like its predecessors, such as the DM&#38;P Vortex86EX2 or Vortex86DX3, the Vortex86EX3 &#8211; also written Vortex86 EX3 &#8211;  supports older PCI and ISA interfaces, as well as more recent interfaces such as PCIe, and the usual serial, CAN Bus, and GPIO found in this type of processor. The Vortex86EX3 is the most powerful x86 SoC from the company so far, with two cores clocked at up to 1.2 GHz to 1.6 GHz. The comparison table below lists the specifications and main features of the Vortex86DX3 (2015), Vortex86EX2 (2019), and the new Vortex86EX3. The Vortex86EX3 is not listed on the Vortex86.com website yet, and instead, I found [...]</p>
