<p>This Classic was handed to me alongside my Uncle Mark's Apple II, which I'll probably cover later (we've played a game of whack-a-mole with issues on that machine! Well worth it but I haven't hit a point where enough things are working to cover it well, heh).</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

<p>ArmSoM RK3588 AI Module7 (AIM7) is a Rockchip RK3588 system-on-module compatible with NVIDIA Jetson Nano and other 260-pin SO-DIMM Jetson modules, so you should be able to use it with a wide range of Jetson carrier boards.  It is designed for edge computing, AI inference, VR/AR, smart NVR systems, and general-purpose applications. The RK3588 AIM7 ships with 4GB to 32GB RAM, 32GB to 128GB eMMC flash, and integrates a Rockchip RK806-1 PMIC, but no Gigabit Ethernet controller as found on the competing Mixtile Core 3588E. While the RK3588 SoM should work on most Jetson carrier boards, ArmSoM has also designed the AIM-IO carrier board to quickly get started with the module.

<p>Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ and W5 Gen 2 are new wearable platforms adding NB-NTN satellite support for emergencies to the Snapdragon W5+/W5 wearable platforms introduced in 2022, and found in various WearOS smartwatches and the Beacon W5 SoM. The W5+/W5 Gen 2 platforms still feature a 1.7 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 processor, an Adreno A702 GPU, an AON QCC5100 ML co-processor (W5+ Gen 2 only), MIPI DSI and MIPI CSI interfaces, cellular connectivity, dual-band WiFi, Bluetooth 5.3, GNSS, and optional NFC support. The main changes are NB-NTN support, an upgrade to 3GPP Rel 17 with Cat 1Bis, a 20% (or 30% depending on where you read) smaller RF frontend, and 50% more accurate GPS in urban or deep canyon areas. Snapdragon W5+/W5 Gen 2 specifications: SWS5100 SoC CPU – Quad-core Cortex-A53 processor @ up to 1.7 GHz GPU – Qualcomm Adreno A702 @ up to 1 GHz with OpenGL ES 3.1 API [...]</p>

<p>Waveshare ESP32-P4-ETH is a compact ESP32-P4 development board with Ethernet and PoE support, which looks very similar to the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit minus the pUEXT connector. However, we&#8217;ve also covered other ESP32-P4 boards with Ethernet (and other features) such as the ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT, the ESP32-P4-NANO board, and the GUITION JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV. Design wise, the board also looks very similar to the Wiznet boards based on Raspberry Pi RP2xxx microcontroller such as the W55RP20-EVB-Pico, the W6300-EVB-Pico2, and the W5100S-EVB-Pico2 boards, but you can also run multimedia workloads with MIPI camera and display interfaces, hardware video encoding, audio processing, AI speech functions, and advanced security features on the ESP32-P4-ETH board.

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) released the Matter 1.4 specification in fall 2024, and we skipped Matter 1.4.1 here, but decided to cover the Matter 1.4.2 release, which enables WiFi only provisioning, removing the need for a Bluetooth LE radio often only used for onboarding Smart Home devices. This will enable device makers to reduce costs and hardware complexity by removing the Bluetooth LE radio and the associated software stack in designs where a BLE radio is only used solely for commissioning.

<p>Raspberry Pi introduced the 7-inch Touch Display 2 with 1280&#215;720 resolution and a thinner design last November. The company has now introduced a 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 that sells for $40 instead of $60 for the 7-inch model. Besides the smaller dimensions, nothing much else changed, as the 5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 keeps the same 1280&#215;720 resolution, 5-point multi-touch capacitive support, 24-bit RGB format, and so on. One difference is the viewing angle: 80° for the new 5-inch model, and 85° for the 7-inch variant.

<p>When RUIPRO asked me to review an HDMI cable, I almost immediately deleted their email. After all, who wants to review a dumb HDMI cable? But I still took a look and noticed that their cable used optical fiber, and they sold HDMI cables up to 300 meters long on Amazon.  My longest HDMI cable is about 1.5 meters long, so I got intrigued and asked for a 100-foot (30-meter) fiber HDMI cable for testing. RUIPRO fiber HDMI cable unboxing When I received the parcel, I got two boxes, so I thought there might be a receiver and a transmitter. But no, they must like me and sent two &#8220;8K detachable pure fiber HDMI cables&#8221;.

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest port by Erik Wierich, Senior Engineer at RISCstar Solutions, demonstrating a practical security implementation for embedded devices using standard Linux tools like dm-verity and TPM 2.0. It covers threat models, filesystem security, and TPM-based encryption with working code examples. Nowadays, it is (rightfully) impossible to put an embedded device into the market without comprehensive embedded device security measures. Most new devices store private data that we do not want to see leaked in dark corners of the Internet. We also want to avoid our device ending up as part of a botnet. Linux has a large set of tools to help us with security. What has historically been lacking is a simple, off-the-shelf way to integrate these tools into a secure-by-default configuration. This post will demonstrate how modern tools simplify deployments while ensuring strong security. Embedded Device Security Scope When talking about embedded system security, [...]</p>

<p>If you found the Pironman 5 and Pironman 5 Max Tower PC cases for the Raspberry Pi 5 pretty cool, but had a hard time justifying paying much more for the enclosure than for the board itself, SunFounder has an update for you. The company has now introduced the Pironman 5 Mini Tower PC enclosure with a similar, yet smaller design, fewer features, and easier assembly, bringing the price down to $45.99. That means the OLED information display, most RGB LEDs, the oversized tower cooler, the micro HDMI to HDMI adapter board, and more are all gone. Pironman 5 Mini features: Compatible SBC &#8211;  Raspberry Pi 5 only. The Raspberry Pi 4 won&#8217;t work, and I can&#8217;t think of another SBC with two micro HDMI ports and the exact same layout as the Pi 5.

<p>Jetway’s MTX-TWL1 is a fanless industrial Mini-ITX motherboard built around the Intel Processor N250 or N150 Twin Lake processor designed for embedded and IoT applications. It supports up to 32GB DDR5 memory, triple 4K display, dual 2.5GbE, SATA, and M.2 slots for NVMe, wireless, or 4G LTE/5G cellular connectivity. Additionally, it features six COM ports, USB 3.2, Type-C with DP Alt Mode, GPIOs, and a wide power and temperature range, making it suitable for In one of our last posts, we wrote about the Jetway JMTX-ADN8, which shares the same Mini-ITX form factor but is powered by Alder Lake-N processors instead. The boards have quite a different layout, but they both use DDR5 SO-DIMM memory, M.2 slots, SATA port, and a wide operating temperature range from -20°C to 60°C for industrial applications.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>At the time, there was no option for upgrading the M4 Pro Mac mini, despite it <em>also</em> using a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121003">user-replaceable</a>, socketed storage drive.</p>
