<p>Canonical has just released a publicly available Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop beta image for the Qualcomm DragonWing QCS6490 and QCS5430 processors, and more specifically for the Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 Vision Kit (QCS6490) and Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 Lite Vision Kit (QCS5430). This adds to the existing Ubuntu 24.04 Server image for the Qualcomm vision kits, and Canonical says the unified image is currently designed for developers, ODMs/OEMs, and customers who want to evaluate the solution, and certified versions of Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop and Server images are coming soon with long term support and maintenance. Canonical explains the image enables the full Ubuntu Desktop experience at the edge with &#8220;powerful AI acceleration with high-performance graphics&#8221; (so I assume that means GPU and NPU are already supported), enhanced camera and multimedia capabilities, sensor integration, and various performance optimizations of the DragonWing family. So the way I read the announcement is that contrary [...]</p>

<p>Seeed Studio&#8217;s XIAO 2-channel Wi-Fi AC Energy Meter is an ESP32-C6 (XIAO ESP32-C6) powered power meter with two independent CT clamp (Current Transformer clamp) connectors to safely measure power consumption when placed around one of the wires from an AC cable. We reviewed the SONOFF POW Ring single-channel WiFi CT clamp power meter with eWelink and Home Assistant last year, and before that, we also covered models supporting multiple CT clamps, up to 16 clamps with the Emporia Vue Gen 2 energy monitor.

<p>Cerebro is a modular board / clusterboard designed to take up to four system-on-modules such as NVIDIA Jetson SO-DIMM modules, Raspberry Pi CM4 or CM5, or Radxa CM5. The board integrated a BMC for intercommunication between the CPU modules. The Cerebro was designed out of frustration as the team at Sparklab Solution could not find a solution where boards would work together seamlessly. While there are other clusterboards for Raspberry Pi Compute modules, the Cerebro motherboard provides more flexibility with three M.2 sockets per node, a built-in BMC and optional expandable BMC, KVM support between each node, dual Ethernet, a 10 Gbps USB 3.2 port, and more.

<p>Espressif Systems has just started mass production of the ESP32-C5 RISC-V wireless microcontroller with dual-band (2.4/5 GHz) WiFi 6, Bluetooth LE, and 802.15.4 (Zigbee, Thread) connectivity. The ESP32-C5-DevKitC-1 development is now available for about $15 on AliExpress, and should soon show up on the company&#8217;s Amazon store. So far, WiFi-capable Espressif microcontrollers have only supported 2.4 GHz WiFi since it&#8217;s cheaper and offers better range for IoT applications, but some applications may benefit from 5 GHz WiFi, so the company unveiled the ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 and BLE RISC-V MCU in June 2022. Design probably took longer than expected, but we noted documentation for an ESP32-C5 beta board in March 2024, and finally, the company has just announced that mass production has started. We&#8217;ll have a closer look at the ESP32-C5-DevKitC-1 board in this article, since it is different from the beta board.

<p>Back in 2023, DASUNG launched its first color E-Ink monitor, quickly followed by BIGME B251 computer and standalone E-Ink monitor. Both were based on the same 23.5-inch E-ink Kaleido 3 color display with 3200&#215;1800 resolution, and were rather pricey at $1,529 (Indiegogo price) and $1,299 (Kickstarter price), respectively. Let&#8217;s revisit color e-paper monitors in 2025 with two new models that were just announced: the DASUNG Paperlike 13K 13.3-inch e-ink color monitor and BOOX Mira Pro (Color version) with the same 23.5-inch E-Ink Kaleido as competing monitors launched in 2023. Those monitors are particularly well-suited for people spending long hours in front of the screen, and don&#8217;t need to watch video and play games due to the lower refresh and ghosting effect. It&#8217;s supposed to be friendlier to eyes, and there&#8217;s no blue light.

<p>Radxa Orion O6 mini-ITX motherboard powered by a CIX P1 12-core Cortex-A720/A520 SoC has just obtained Arm SystemReady SR (ServerReady) v2.5 certification, meaning it&#8217;s been shown to run unmodified several OS images such as Windows and Ubuntu. I&#8217;ve already tested a Debian 12 image modified by Radxa on the Orion O6, but one of the goals of the platform was to provide a universal UEFI + ACPI firmware to boot any Arm ISO released by OS vendors, for instance, the Ubuntu Desktop ISO for Arm 64-bit architecture downloaded directly from the Ubuntu website. The Arm SystemReady SR certification is a step in the right direction, as it means the Orion O6 has passed a number of tests showing it can boot several off-the-shelf OS images. We&#8217;ll find Radxa&#8217;s Orion O6 listed on the Arm SystemReady Compliance page among boards from other manufacturers, as well as the Radxa ROCK Pi 4B+, [...]</p>

<p>The ODROID-H4 SBC powered by an Intel Processor N97 or Core i3-N305 Alder Lake-N CPU has been shown to work with up to 64GB DDR5 since Crucial/Micron released such modules earlier this year. There&#8217;s always been a lot of confusion about the maximum memory supported by Alder Lake-N CPU, mostly due to Intel Ark, which should be a trusted official source, but that will often wrongly report a maximum of 16GB RAM: But people quickly found out that 32GB RAM would work just fine, and the guys at Hardkernel even tested several 48GB RAM modules successfully when they launched the ODROID-H4/H4+/H4 Ultra single board computers last year. But domih noted that 64GB DDR5 SO-DIMM modules were now available, and several members of the odroid forums purchased 64GB CT64G56C46S5 DDR5 memory modules to give it a try. It worked for them.

<p>It is of fundamental importance across a broad range of electrical projects to ensure the right wire size is chosen for the given application. Accordingly, then, there are few more critically needed skills among electricians and engineers than knowing how to convert from AWG to mm2. Before we go any further, let’s quickly set out these two units of measurement: “AWG”, of course, refers to American Wire Gauge – a standardised wire gauge system that goes back to the mid-19th century. As its name indicates, AWG is predominantly used in North America. In Europe and elsewhere in the world, however, millimetres squared, or “mm2”, see widespread use for directly measuring a cable’s cross-sectional area, or CSA. In some contexts, then, you might see AWG being used, while in others, references to wire size may be in mm2. Being able to quickly convert between these two systems will help ensure both [...]</p>
