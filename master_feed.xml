<p>The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has just adopted the Bluetooth 6.1 Core Specification with the addition of the randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA) Updates feature and several errata. The Randomized RPA updates feature is designed to enhance privacy and power efficiency in Bluetooth devices by randomizing the timing of address changes to make it much more difficult for third parties to track or correlate device activity over time, and offloading the address change operation to the Controller to help the Bluetooth device extend its battery life. That&#8217;s about all there is for Bluetooth 6.1, except some errata like &#8220;Pause Encryption should be mandatory to support with encryption&#8221;. You&#8217;ll find the latest specification on the Bluetooth website, as well as a page specific to Randomized RPA Updates. None of the usual silicon vendors like Silicon Labs, Nordic Semi, or NXP have announced any updates to Bluetooth 6.1. One of the [...]</p>

<p>HydraLink is a compact USB-to-Automotive Ethernet dongle that supports 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 standards over a single twisted pair (no large RJ45 connector needed) and providing a solution for diagnosing, testing, and prototyping automotive networks. The rational behind HydraLink is that the automotive sector is undergoing a shift from CAN-based systems to advance Automotive Ethernet networks like BroadR-Reach (802.3bw) that allows multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cables.  So as I understand it, the HydraLink is the modern equivalent of OBD-II USB scanners which relies on Ethernet instead. HydraLink specifications: Networking &#8211; 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps automotive Ethernet via 2.54 mm pin header (Note: the board below features a Broadcom BCM89811 BroadR-Reach automotive Ethernet RGMII transceiver limited to 100BASE-T1 data rate) USB &#8211; USB 3.0 Gen 1 Type-C port Misc &#8211; Link activity and link speed LED indicators Power Supply &#8211;  5V via USB [...]</p>

<p>Some programs and most games are designed for x86 hardware, and we&#8217;ve already seen projects like box86 x86 emulator for 32-bit Arm targets and Box64 x86-64 emulator for 64-bit Arm hardware to run games on Arm hardware. The Felix86 x86-64 emulator is similar to Box64, except it targets specifically RISC-V hardware. The project is very new, but it can already run some Linux games like World of Goo 2, SuperTuxKart, and Quake OpenArena, while the Wine emulator can currently handle simple Windows games like Solitaire. You&#8217;ll find the full compatibility list on the project&#8217;s website.

<p>Canonical has just released a publicly available Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop beta image for the Qualcomm DragonWing QCS6490 and QCS5430 processors, and more specifically for the Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 Vision Kit (QCS6490) and Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 Lite Vision Kit (QCS5430). This adds to the existing Ubuntu 24.04 Server image for the Qualcomm vision kits, and Canonical says the unified image is currently designed for developers, ODMs/OEMs, and customers who want to evaluate the solution, and certified versions of Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop and Server images are coming soon with long term support and maintenance. Canonical explains the image enables the full Ubuntu Desktop experience at the edge with &#8220;powerful AI acceleration with high-performance graphics&#8221; (so I assume that means GPU and NPU are already supported), enhanced camera and multimedia capabilities, sensor integration, and various performance optimizations of the DragonWing family.

<p>Cerebro is a modular board / clusterboard designed to take up to four system-on-modules such as NVIDIA Jetson SO-DIMM modules, Raspberry Pi CM4 or CM5, or Radxa CM5. The board integrated a BMC for intercommunication between the CPU modules. The Cerebro was designed out of frustration as the team at Sparklab Solution could not find a solution where boards would work together seamlessly. While there are other clusterboards for Raspberry Pi Compute modules, the Cerebro motherboard provides more flexibility with three M.2 sockets per node, a built-in BMC and optional expandable BMC, KVM support between each node, dual Ethernet, a 10 Gbps USB 3.2 port, and more.

<p>Espressif Systems has just started mass production of the ESP32-C5 RISC-V wireless microcontroller with dual-band (2.4/5 GHz) WiFi 6, Bluetooth LE, and 802.15.4 (Zigbee, Thread) connectivity. The ESP32-C5-DevKitC-1 development is now available for about $15 on AliExpress, and should soon show up on the company&#8217;s Amazon store. So far, WiFi-capable Espressif microcontrollers have only supported 2.4 GHz WiFi since it&#8217;s cheaper and offers better range for IoT applications, but some applications may benefit from 5 GHz WiFi, so the company unveiled the ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 and BLE RISC-V MCU in June 2022. Design probably took longer than expected, but we noted documentation for an ESP32-C5 beta board in March 2024, and finally, the company has just announced that mass production has started. We&#8217;ll have a closer look at the ESP32-C5-DevKitC-1 board in this article, since it is different from the beta board.

<p>Back in 2023, DASUNG launched its first color E-Ink monitor, quickly followed by BIGME B251 computer and standalone E-Ink monitor. Both were based on the same 23.5-inch E-ink Kaleido 3 color display with 3200&#215;1800 resolution, and were rather pricey at $1,529 (Indiegogo price) and $1,299 (Kickstarter price), respectively. Let&#8217;s revisit color e-paper monitors in 2025 with two new models that were just announced: the DASUNG Paperlike 13K 13.3-inch e-ink color monitor and BOOX Mira Pro (Color version) with the same 23.5-inch E-Ink Kaleido as competing monitors launched in 2023. Those monitors are particularly well-suited for people spending long hours in front of the screen, and don&#8217;t need to watch video and play games due to the lower refresh and ghosting effect. It&#8217;s supposed to be friendlier to eyes, and there&#8217;s no blue light.

<p>Radxa Orion O6 mini-ITX motherboard powered by a CIX P1 12-core Cortex-A720/A520 SoC has just obtained Arm SystemReady SR (ServerReady) v2.5 certification, meaning it&#8217;s been shown to run unmodified several OS images such as Windows and Ubuntu. I&#8217;ve already tested a Debian 12 image modified by Radxa on the Orion O6, but one of the goals of the platform was to provide a universal UEFI + ACPI firmware to boot any Arm ISO released by OS vendors, for instance, the Ubuntu Desktop ISO for Arm 64-bit architecture downloaded directly from the Ubuntu website. The Arm SystemReady SR certification is a step in the right direction, as it means the Orion O6 has passed a number of tests showing it can boot several off-the-shelf OS images.

<p>The ODROID-H4 SBC powered by an Intel Processor N97 or Core i3-N305 Alder Lake-N CPU has been shown to work with up to 64GB DDR5 since Crucial/Micron released such modules earlier this year. There&#8217;s always been a lot of confusion about the maximum memory supported by Alder Lake-N CPU, mostly due to Intel Ark, which should be a trusted official source, but that will often wrongly report a maximum of 16GB RAM: But people quickly found out that 32GB RAM would work just fine, and the guys at Hardkernel even tested several 48GB RAM modules successfully when they launched the ODROID-H4/H4+/H4 Ultra single board computers last year. But domih noted that 64GB DDR5 SO-DIMM modules were now available, and several members of the odroid forums purchased 64GB CT64G56C46S5 DDR5 memory modules to give it a try. It worked for them.

<p>Romanian company Zalmotek has recently introduced three new SoMs, the RA6M1, RA8M1, and RZ/A3UL, and a modular carrier board designed for embedded applications such as robotics, industrial control, and edge computing. There are a few things that I find interesting about this setup. The SoM comes in Adafruit Feather form factor and, as a result, supports various Adafruit FeatherWings. The modular carrier board supports the Dynamixel motor driver module, the Particle M-SoM breakout module, Ethernet, and CAN modules. The RA6M1 Feather SoM is powered by a Renesas RA6M1 Arm Cortex-M4 CPU at up to 120 MHz, with 512 KB flash and 96 KB SRAM while the RA8M1 Feather SoM features a Renesas RA8M1 64-bit Arm Cortex-M85 running at up to 360 MHz with 128 Mbit SPI flash, the RZ/A3UL Feather SoM is based on a Renesas RZ/A3UL 64-bit Arm Cortex-A55 CPU at up to 1 GHz, with 512 Mbit OctaFlash [...]</p>

<p>Arduino recently announced that their Cloud Editor now includes an AI assistant based on Anthropic’s Claude large language model (LLM). The AI assistant is designed to make the coding experience smoother by providing intelligent, context-aware support directly within the Cloud Editor. This tool understands your specific board, libraries, and project setup, and generates code and fixes bugs. It also explains functions without requiring users to leave the development environment. Additionally, it reduces repetitive tasks by creating reliable boilerplate code and accelerates development with natural language prompt-based sketch generation, instant debugging, and detailed code explanations.  These features make this tool useful for hobbyists, educators, and developers seeking to boost productivity and creativity in embedded projects. &#8211; Main features of Arduino&#8217;s AI assistant Platform &#8211; Integrated into Arduino Cloud Editor (app.arduino.cc) Compatibility &#8211; Exclusive to Arduino Cloud Editor (not available in the desktop IDE) AI Model &#8211; Powered by Anthropic Claude LLM [...]</p>
