<p>It is of fundamental importance across a broad range of electrical projects to ensure the right wire size is chosen for the given application. Accordingly, then, there are few more critically needed skills among electricians and engineers than knowing how to convert from AWG to mm2. Before we go any further, let’s quickly set out these two units of measurement: “AWG”, of course, refers to American Wire Gauge – a standardised wire gauge system that goes back to the mid-19th century. As its name indicates, AWG is predominantly used in North America. In Europe and elsewhere in the world, however, millimetres squared, or “mm2”, see widespread use for directly measuring a cable’s cross-sectional area, or CSA. In some contexts, then, you might see AWG being used, while in others, references to wire size may be in mm2. Being able to quickly convert between these two systems will help ensure both [...]</p>

<p>SPARK Microsystems SR1120 is the company&#8217;s second-generation ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless transceiver capable of up to 41 Mbps throughput at ultra-low power and up to 100 times lower power ranging than UWB competitors. The Canadian company also highlights the outperformance of their UWB solution over Bluetooth with the new SR1120 offering 40 times higher data rates than Bluetooth chips, while consuming 25 times less power than Bluetooth and offering 60 times lower latency. However, readers should note that Bluetooth LE is supposed to support up to 2 Mbps, so it should (only) be up to about 20 times faster, and Bluetooth HDT is coming soon with data rates of up to 7.5 Mbps to further narrow the gap. SPARK SR1120 key features and specifications: Compliant with the upcoming IEEE 802.15.4ab low-energy UWB PHY standard Dynamically reconfigurable UWB spectrum 6.2–9.5 GHz band Up to 3 dBm TX power RX sensitivity of -81 [...]</p>

The SD 7.0 specification was introduced in 2018, adding the SD Express standard using PCIe and NVMe Interfaces for speeds of up to 985 MB/s. Since then, the SD 9.0 specification was ratified in 2023 upping the speed to 4GB/s with SD 8.0 Express. But while the specifications have evolved over the years, and some SD and microSD Express cards were unveiled, including 256GB and 512GB Samsung microSD Express cards, market adoption has been slow since hosts need to support the new format, but few manufacturers do.

<p>ANAVI Miracle Emitter is an open-source hardware ESP32-C3 WiFi and BLE controller designed to control 5V addressable RGB LED strips, which works with Home Assistant over MQTT and also supports the popular WLED firmware to easily control the LED strip through a web interface. It also features four I2C expansion headers for sensors and a small OLED display, a UART header, and a GPIO header. It&#8217;s an update to Leon ANAVI&#8217;s Miracle Controller introduced in 2019 with an ESP8266.

<p>Openviro Axe PoE is a rack-mountable, open-source environmental sensor designed to measure the temperature and humidity (and air pressure) in server rooms or cabinets with electrical equipment. The device is based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040 board with Ethernet connectivity housed in an aluminum enclosure and equipped with two RJ12 connectors for Bosch BME280 sensors with an accuracy of +/- 0.5°C. It provides better results than sensors placed in a machine that may be impacted by the internal components&#8217; heat dissipation. For instance, the two sensor inputs can be used to measure the temperature and humidity of the intake and exhaust in a server rack.

The mesh network relies on nodes to communicate with each other and relay messages to other nodes if needed. However, this does not work reliably when nodes are too far apart or one node goes offline for whatever reason. That&#8217;s when Meshtastic repeaters are needed.

<p>Axelera Metis Computer Board is a Rockchip RK3588 mini-ITX motherboard equipped with a Metis AIPU (AI Processing Unit) capable of delivering up to 214 TOPS, 16GB LPDDR4 memory for the CPU, and 4GB LPDDR4x RAM for the AI accelerator. I first came across the Axelera Metis AIPU in M.2 and PCIe card in 2023, and I was rather impressed with the advertised 214 TOPS of AI performance promised in this form factor and relatively affordable $149 price tag considering the price-to-performance ratio. At the time, it was still hard to source the chip and module due to limited quantities, and in 2024, it became easier to evaluate the solution with the Axelera Metis PCIe Arm AI evaluation kit based on a Fireﬂy ITX-3588J mini-ITX motherboard equipped with a 214 TOPS Metis AIPU PCIe card.
