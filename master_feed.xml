<p>LWMalloc is an ultra-lightweight dynamic memory allocator designed for embedded systems that is said to outperform ptmalloc used in Glibc, achieving up to 53% faster execution time and 23% lower memory usage. Malloc can cause memory fragmentation on embedded systems, potentially leading to crashes after the firmware runs long enough. Garbage collection is one technique for lowering fragmentation, but it&#8217;s not always practical on resource-constrained devices, and some simply avoid using malloc in their firmware, preferring static memory allocation or memory pools to improve reliability. Custom dynamic memory allocators are another option, and that&#8217;s what LWMalloc provides. LWMalloc is described in a paper entitled &#8220;LWMalloc: A Lightweight Dynamic Memory Allocator for Resource-Constrained Environments&#8221; as follows: LWMalloc incorporates a lightweight data structure, a deferred coalescing (DC) policy, and dedicated small chunk pools to optimize memory allocation. The lightweight data structure minimizes metadata overhead, ensuring a compact and efficient implementation. The DC [...]</p>

<p>AAEON MIX-MTLD1 is an industrial Mini-ITX motherboard supporting out-of-band (OOB) management and powered by an Intel Core Ultra Meteor Lake H/U processor (Intel Core Ultra 5 125H by default). The board supports up to 96 GB of DDR5-5600 memory, PCIe Gen 5 expansion, dual LAN, and various I/O options, including seven USB and four COM headers, and has a design fairly similar to the Jetway MTX-ARH1 released last week, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H or Core Ultra 7 155H SoC. What makes the MIX-MTLD1 different is the NCSI header for out-of-band (OOB) management using a MOD-RMB module, which links the Ethernet controller to a BMC for remote monitoring and control independently of the OS running on the CPU. This feature is common in servers, but more rare in industrial Mini-ITX boards, although we previously covered the DFI RPS101/RPS103 mini-ITX motherboards and HoneyComb Ryzen V3000 motherboard featuring OOB management [...]</p>

<p>Today, we’ll do a quick review of the new SONOFF CAM-PT2 indoor camera, which is the third model after the Slim Gen2 (CAM S2) fixed-angle camera and the Slim camera, both of which we reviewed previously. The CAM-PT2 (CAM Pan-Tilt 2) supports Pan/Tilt/Zoom functions. Its main features are quite similar to the CAM S2, including 1080p resolution, Motion Detection/AI Human Detection, and Privacy Zone support. In addition to Pan/Tilt, it adds new features such as the ability to set Preset Points to remember specific camera positions. It’s also the first SONOFF camera to support ONVIF, on top of RTSP, which has been available since the CAM S2. Let’s take a closer look at the details. SONOFF CAM-PT2 unboxing Inside the white box, you’ll find the camera itself, a mini manual, a USB-C cable, wall plugs with screws, a drilling sticker, and a camera holder.

<p>Designed by Altware Dev Shop in the US, the Blackout Comms is an off-grid, LoRa-based encrypted mesh communication system built around ESP32 for texting and GPS location sharing without the need for any cellular networks or internet. The device uses asymmetric encryption and digital signatures for secure communication during blackouts, emergencies, or in remote areas where connectivity is unavailable. The device seemed a little bit pricey at first, but the complete kit includes two customized T-Deck communicators and one Altware Link/Node, all pre-configured and ready to use. Each communicator features a DFRobot GPS, Adafruit DS3231 real-time clock, 5000 mAh battery (≈48-hour runtime), external antenna, and PETG printed case, while the Link/Node integrates its own GPS, RTC, 3000 mAh+ battery, and antenna for cluster support.

<p>MNT Reform has launched a crowdfunding campaign for the RCORE V2 module powered by a Rockchip RK3588 SoC coupled with up to 32GB RAM, and a 256GB eMMC flash for the company&#8217;s open-source hardware laptops, be it the original MNT Reform or the MNT Reform Pocket. It appears to me that it&#8217;s the same module as found in the MNT Reform Next 12.5-inch laptop scheduled to ship by the end of December, but it&#8217;s sold separately as an upgrade kit for users of previous models of MNT Reform laptops. The company explains that the RCORE V2 brings a third M.2 slot for fast PCIe-based Wi-Fi cards (with USB Bluetooth), and it&#8217;s easier to install since it works without an internal HDMI adapter.

<p>Cloud costs can quickly grow faster than a startup&#8217;s growth, but with the right strategy, small teams can control expenses without compromising performance. Oversized or idle resources quietly drain budgets, and for startups, every unnecessary expense is money not invested in product, customers, or development. Over time, this quiet drain slows progress. The solution is to manage infrastructure with intention: right-size resources, automate scaling, and monitor usage closely. With the right approach, startups can keep cloud spending under control while maintaining the performance, scalability, and reliability needed to deliver an intense experience for their users. The Startup Cloud Cost Challenge Many startups overspend on cloud services because they focus on building, selling, and launching, rather than fine-tuning their infrastructure. This can lead to a few common missteps: Paying for more compute power than necessary Running services around the clock, even when idle Choosing complex infrastructure designed for enterprise workloads rather [...]</p>

<p>Forlinx Embedded FET3506J-C is an ultra-small system-on-module (SoM) based on Rockchip RK3506J triple-core Cortex-A7 SoC measuring just 40 x 29mm, and equipped with up to 512MB DDR3, and 256MB NAND flash, or 8GB eMMC flash. I first thought I had already written about it, but the Forlinx FET3506J-S module introduced last March has a different design. It measures 44 x 35mm and exposes all I/Os through castellated holes, while the FET3506J-C features two 80-pin board-to-board (B2B) connectors instead.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/macintosh-classic-on-desk.jpeg" width="700" height="467" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-72ec0edd-bedd-4eb3-ba56-75e7509ea20a" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;72ec0edd-bedd-4eb3-ba56-75e7509ea20a&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Macintosh Classic on desk"></p>

<p>This Classic was handed to me alongside my Uncle Mark's Apple II, which I'll probably cover later (we've played a game of whack-a-mole with issues on that machine! Well worth it but I haven't hit a point where enough things are working to cover it well, heh).</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<p>This is not a Raspberry Pi Pico. Despite it's tiny size and castellated edges, this is <em>actually</em> a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

I'm up to 5 little LoRa radios now, and I'm working on a couple nicer antenna placements, so I can hopefully help shore up some of the north-south connections on the <a href="https://meshstl.org/#meshmap">MeshSTL map</a>.</p>

<p>To better understand the protocol, I wanted to visualize Meshtastic communications using SDR (Software Defined Radio).

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>
