<p>Synaptics unveiled an extension to its Astra Native AI platform with the new SR series of MCUs. This new product family, unlike the Astra SL series released last year, isn&#8217;t comprised of Linux-capable application processors. Instead, the Arm Cortex-M55 microcontrollers focus on providing high-performance, AI-native processing for Edge AI applications leveraging a built-in Arm Ethos-U55 NPU. Built on the Arm Cortex-M55 core and the Arm Ethos-U55 neural processing unit (NPU), these MCUs are optimized for multimodal applications, including vision, audio, and voice processing. As indicated in the MCU&#8217;s block diagram (see below), the SR series also features an optional low processing SoC unit featuring an Arm Cortex-M4 @ 100MHz and a Synaptics micro NPU engine.

<p>Consumer-grade heat pipe cooling solutions typically rely on water as a working fluid. This works great until a system needs to be used in freezing conditions, since the water could turn into ice and damage the pipe or even parts of the computer. That&#8217;s why congatec has unveiled a heat pipe cooling solution that relies on acetone as a working fluid in the heat pipes instead of water. It will work reliably at extreme sub-zero temperatures down to -40°C, and the company also claims the solution is insensitive to mechanical stresses such as shock and vibration. The acetone-based cooling solution will be used in conjunction with Computer-on-Module (COMs) from the company such as the COM Express Type 6 conga-TC675 or rugged-version conga-TC675r powered by up to 45W Intel Raptor Lake processor, as well as COM HPC Mini, Client or Server modules. Congatec explains that it will lower the cost of [...]</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just reviewed the SunFounder 10.1-inch touchscreen display with Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS, and the experience was not quite as smooth as I had expected, so I&#8217;ll report some tips to save people time. The first is the software keyboard. Matchbox keyboard used to be the go-to solution, but two years ago, my preferred keyboard became the Onboard keyboard. Sadly, it&#8217;s not working so well with the latest Raspberry Pi OS using labwc Wayland window-stacking compositor, so now Raspberry Pi recommends squeekboard. It was not installed by default, but installation is fairly easy: [crayon-67d267695bb77814505395/] It did not show up automatically when trying to type in a text field, maybe because I&#8217;m using a third-party touchscreen keyboard, but going to Raspberry Pi Configuration and setting On-screen Keyboard to Enabled always in the Display tab fixed that. I was able to type a URL/web search terms in the URL [...]</p>

<p>SunFounder has just sent us one of their 10.1-inch touchscreen display designed for single board computers (SBCs) for review. It supports the Raspberry Pi family, but not only, thanks to a flexible design that allows mounting all sorts of boards with mounting holes that fit within an 85x70mm area. All you need is a board with HDMI output, a spare USB port for the touchscreen, and 5V USB-C input (up to 5A). So I&#8217;ll first test the SunFounder 10.1-inch touchscreen display with a Raspberry Pi 5 (85x56mm), then a larger Radxa ROCK 5 Model B Pico-ITX SBC (100 x 72mm). Since the display can also be used as an external touchscreen monitor, I&#8217;ll also try it with my laptop in Ubuntu 24.04 and Windows 11.

<p>Previously u-blox announced the release of the X20 series of all-band GNSS modules, but at the time, the company did not disclose detailed specifications for the module. Recently, they have launched the ZED-X20P all-band GNSS module designed to deliver centimeter-level global positioning at a significantly lower cost, up to 90% less than traditional solutions when considering the total cost of ownership. The module supports L1, L2, L5, and L6 bands across four GNSS constellations (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou), along with SBAS, QZSS, and NavIC. Additionally, the module is compatible with PPP-RTK, network RTK, and global PPP correction services, along with u-blox’s PointPerfect and Galileo’s free High Accuracy Service (HAS), ensuring precise and flexible positioning. It also features secure boot, signed firmware, encrypted communication, and anti-jamming capabilities, for critical applications. The ZED-X20P maintains the ZED form factor, making the footprint compatible with the ZED-F9P chip for easier upgrades. u-blox says [...]</p>

But for those looking at upgrading from an existing EPYC 9004 series server and bound by the motherboard BIOS support and/or cooling/power capacity, 400 Watts is a sweet spot. Many of the existing platforms designed for EPYC 9004 Bergamo/Genoa(X) and now extended for EPYC 9005 Turin are limited to a 400 Watt TDP. With the prior AMD EPYC 9655 testing I have already shown off the great Zen 5 uplift when maintaining the same core counts as Zen 4, but even sticking to 400 Watts at the top-end is room for more. The EPYC 9845 is AMD's top-end SKU for 400 Watts or less that allows for 160 dense cores (320 threads) per socket compared to the 128 core EPYC 9754 Bergamo. Effectively the same power level and 25% more -- and better (Zen 5C) -- cores. Plus with EPYC Turin supporting the new AMD P-State CPU frequency scaling driver there is greater headroom in optimizing for power efficiency if so desired. Here is a look at how the AMD EPYC 9845 delivers a great leap to performance and power efficiency for those looking at a surprisingly robust upgrade from prior generation EPYC 9004.]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Fedora 43 Looking At RPM 6.0, JPEG-XL Wallpapers &amp; Other Early Change Proposals</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-43-RPM-6.0-Early-Changes</link><description><![CDATA[Fedora 42 isn't even releasing until next month but a number of early change proposals have been filed for the upcoming Fedora 43 development cycle that will be released this autumn...]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 13:58:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ASUS PRIME X670E-PRO WIFI &amp; AMD BC-250 Sensor Monitoring With Linux 6.15</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-Early-HWMON</link><description><![CDATA[The hardware monitoring "HWMON" subsystem updates are building up ahead of the Linux 6.15 merge window opening up later this month.

<p>Security is hard. Just as Espressif Systems announced PSA Level 2 for the ESP32-C6 microcontroller, Spain-based cybersecurity company Tarlogic published their findings about a hidden Bluetooth functionality that can be used as a backdoor in the previous generation ESP32, and gave a presentation in Spanish at Rootedcon 2025. Specifically, they found hidden proprietary Bluetooth HCI (Host Controller Interface) commands used to read &#38; write controller memory, and typically used for debugging. However, they could also facilitate supply chain attacks, the concealment of backdoors in the chipset, or the execution of more sophisticated attacks. Tarlogic initially called it a &#8220;backdoor&#8221;, but some disputed the claim (more on that later), and the company eventually issued an update downgrading it to a &#8220;hidden&#8221; feature: We would like to clarify that it is more appropriate to refer to the presence of proprietary HCI commands—which allow operations such as reading and modifying memory in the [...]</p>

<p>I've already checked out the hardware of the UP Squared 7100 fanless SBC in the first part of the review with an unboxing and first boot to Ubuntu Pro 24.04. I've now had time to test the features of the Intel N100 SBC with Ubuntu Pro, so I'll report my experience with the system in this second part of the review.</p>
<p>I'll report my experience with Ubuntu Pro features, test hardware features of the board including GPIOs, check out BIOS options, run a few benchmarks, and measurement power consumption.</p>

<p>While the Orange Pi RV RISC-V SBC introduced at the Orange Pi Developer Conference 2024 last year is yet to be launched (should be up in a few days), the company has just launched the Orange Pi RV2 powered by the Ky X1 octa-core RISC-V SoC with a 2 TOPS AI accelerator, up to 8GB LPDD4X, optional eMMC flash moduyle, two M.2 sockets for storeage, dual gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 5, and more. While RISC-V has made a lot of progress over the years, Linux RISC-V SBCs were often synonymous with relatively expensive hardware for developers, since software is often unsuitable for production, at least for applications using graphics. The Orange Pi RV2 addresses the cost issue since the octa-core RISC-V SBC sells for just $30 to $49.90 depending on the configuration. Orange Pi RV2 specifications: SoC &#8211; Ky X1 CPU &#8211; 8-core 64-bit RISC-V processor GPU &#8211; Not mentioned VPU [...]</p>

<p>Arm introduced the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) back in 2017 to make Internet of Things (IoT) chips more secure. Since then we&#8217;ve seen many PSA certified products such as Silicon Labs&#8217;  EFR32FG23 (FG23) and EFR32ZG23 (ZG23) Cortex-M33 microcontrollers with PSA Level 3 certification. But as announced in 2017, PSA is architecture-agnostic, and the security architecture has gone beyond just certifying Arm microcontrollers, as shown by Espressif Systems who just announced that the ESP32-C6 RISC-V wireless microcontroller was now PSA Level 2 certified. The ESP32-C3 RISC-V MCU also achieved PSA certification earlier, but at the lower Level 1. The PSA-L2 certification was mostly made possible thanks to the ESP-TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) firmware that provides hardware-enforced isolation to enhance security for operations such as cryptographic key management, secure boot verification, and firmware updates. Espressif also reminded us of ESP32-C6&#8217;s hardware security features in the announcement: Physical Memory Protection (PMP) and Access [...]</p>

<p>Zant is an open-source, cross-platform SDK written in Zig and designed to simplify deploying Neural Networks (NN) on microcontrollers. It comprises a suite of tools to import, optimize, and deploy NNs to low-end hardware. The developers behind the project developed Zant (formerly known as Zig-ant) after noticing many microcontrollers lacked robust deep learning libraries, and made sure it would be on various platforms such as ARM Cortex-M or RISC-V microcontrollers, or even x86 targets. Contrary to platforms like Edge Impulse that focus on network creation, Zant is about deployment and outputs a static, highly optimized library ready to be integrated into any existing work stack. Zant highlights: Optimized Performance &#8211; Supports quantization, pruning, and hardware acceleration techniques such as SIMD and GPU offloading. Low memory footprint &#8211; Zant employs memory pooling, static allocation, and buffer optimization to work on resources-constrained targets. Ease of Integration: With a modular design, clear APIs, [...]</p>

<p>Mekotronics R58-4&#215;4 3U is yet another device based on Rockchip RK3588 from the company, but this product is a 4K video encoder with four SDI inputs, and four SDI loop outputs mirroring the SDI inputs. SDI (Serial Digital Interface) inputs are used for transmitting uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals and typically found in professional video production and broadcasting environments. The SDI interface can also be found in security cameras like the MOKOSE SHD50-2.8-12MM and I can also see it used in cameras designed for live streaming on YouTube, or other services. The main advantages of SDI over interfaces like USB, HDMI, or Ethernet, are that it can use longer cables up to 300 meters, offers better signal integrity, and has near zero latency. Compatibility for professional camera equipment is another advantage. Let&#8217;s look at the Mekotronics R58-4&#215;4 3U specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3588 octa-core processor with CPU – 4x CortexA76  [...]</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Nvidia GPUs have been running fine on Arm for a while now—I just upgraded the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">System76 Thelio Astra</a> to an RTX 4080 Super and am testing it now.</p>

<p>But Nvidia seems to have a partnership with Ampere, which probably leads to their drivers getting priority support, and likely a few special edge cases in code to work around a couple PCIe quirks on the Altra CPUs. Nvidia <em>also</em> builds their own Arm CPUs—a <em>lot</em> of them—so Arm support is definitely a priority for them.</p>

            <p>Today I set up a new DeskPi RackMate 12U model, the T2, and compared it to the other existing models (T0 / 4U and T1 / 8U)... and I have to ask: at what point are these racks not 'mini' anymore?</p>

            <p></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.</p>

<p>Handling power outages is never a top priority... until it's the <em>only</em> priority! And by then it's usually too late! Luckily for me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.</p>

<p>This week the power company emailed and said they'd be cutting power for maintenance next week, but they don't have an exact time. So it's even more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!</p>

            <p>Recently, I've been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647">Radxa's Dual 2.5G Router HAT</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using <em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>'s <code>--bind</code> option (like <code>--bind [ip address of interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces—it would just route all traffic through one!</p>

<p>Luckily, I found the issue <a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, @bmah888 mentioned the <code>--bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.</p>

<p>Using that option (like <code>--bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3 -s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both connections as much as the Pi will allow:</p>

<p>SiFive's <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">HiFive Premier P550</a> is a strange board. It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've tested—though I haven't tested a <a href="https://milkv.io/megrez">Milk-V Megrez</a>. It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>
