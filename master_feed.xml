<p>Bela Gem Stereo and Bela Gem Multi are audio and sensor add-on boards designed for the PocketBeagle 2 SBC powered by a Texas Instruments Sitara AM6232/AM6254 dual-core or quad-core SoC. As its name implies, the Bela Gem Stereo board features two audio outputs and inputs, while the Bela Gem Multi board offers more flexibility with ten audio interfaces for more complex audio projects such as spatial audio systems. Both boards can be expanded through headers with sixteen GPIO and eight analog inputs, as well as a Qwicc I2C connector.

<p>Embedr is an AI-powered Arduino-like IDE designed to simplify development for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. It looks very similar to the Cursor code editor and uses Microsoft’s Monaco Editor and Arduino CLI tools to enable features such as intelligent code suggestions, project skeleton generation, and visual debugging. Embedr has all the Arduino features that you are familiar with, and on top of that, you can add other LLMs and experiment just by adding the required plugin and connecting them via API keys. We’ve previously seen Arduino release their Claude-based Arduino Cloud Editor, which runs in the browser for context-aware coding assistance. But the problem with that is, if you don’t have internet, you can’t use the IDE. Embedr runs locally and uses Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM, meaning you can compile and debug your code offline without needing a constant internet connection. Additionally, Embedr gives you greater control and privacy compared to [...]</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>There are already many cheap ESP32 drones on AliExpress, or you can even make an ESP32 DIY drone for about $12, but 01Studio&#8217;s pyDrone is a little different as it&#8217;s based on an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module and runs MicroPython firmware instead of the ESP32-Drone firmware. The pyDrone can be controlled over WiFi or Bluetooth using the pyController gamepad, also based on the same ESP32-S3 module. Another advantage of the pyDrone is that it comes with a connector for the OV2640 camera module that&#8217;s often missing in other low-cost ESP32 drones. pyDrone specifications: Wireless Module &#8211; ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 SoC – ESP32-S3N8R8 CPU &#8211; Dual-core Tensilica LX7 up to 240 MHz RAM &#8211; 512KB SRAM, up to 8MB PSRAM Storage &#8211; 8MB flash Wireless – WiFi 4 and Bluetooth LE 5 Antenna &#8211; PCB antenna Motors &#8211; 4x 716 hollow cup motors Blades &#8211; 46mm propeller blades Flight range WiFi &#8211; 120 meters Bluetooth [...]</p>

<p>SunFounder has sent me a review sample of the Pironman 5 Max Tower PC case for the Raspberry Pi 5 SBC. We had already reviewed the Pironman 5 last year, but the new Max model has various improvements, including a sleeker design made of black aluminum and semi-transparent black acrylic panels, a dual NVMe PiP expansion board for two M.2 NVMe SSDs (optionally in RAID 0/1 configuration), or one NVMe SSD and one AI accelerator module, a Tap-to-Wake feature for the OLED information display, and programmable RGB LEDs for the two fans.

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

<p>The WisGate Connect for MIOTY is an industrial-grade hybrid IoT gateway with support for both MIOTY and LoRaWAN protocols. Built around the RAK7391 carrier board for Raspberry Pi CM4, it is designed for long-range IoT applications, including intelligent street lighting, waste management, environmental monitoring, and traffic flow control. In addition to dual-protocol (MIOTY and LoRaWAN) support, it features USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and a USB-C port for flashing, an HDMI output, and a UART header for debugging. Backhaul options include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or an optional 4G LTE module. The gateway can be powered in two ways: a wide input voltage DC jack or terminal block, or optional PoE+. We first wrote about the MIOTY Standard back in April 2020. After that, in September 2021, we saw Silicon Labs introduce EFR32FG23 (FG23) and EFR32ZG23 (ZG23) SoCs with MIOTY support, but it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve covered products built around this standard.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>

<p>I'm deep in the rabbit hole of all things time and timing. One step on any modern horologist's journey is GPS time.</p>

<p>NIST just <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-keeps-world-time">put NIST-F4 online</a>, accurate to within 2.2e-16 ppm (that's <code>0.00000000000000022</code> seconds. The clock is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1681-7575/adc7bd">described in Metrologia</a> thusly:</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've been deep into time and timing lately (more shenanigans coming tomorrow), but today I posted a video covering the install of a <a href="https://www.pctel.com/antenna-product/timing-antenna-with-integrated-lightning-protection/">PCTEL GPS/GNSS antenna</a> at my studio.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/gps-antenna-geerling-engineering.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-37750169-3482-489c-9ddc-4101f212bc3e" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;37750169-3482-489c-9ddc-4101f212bc3e&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="GPS Antenna Install at Geerling Engineering Studios"></p>

<p>I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p></div>
