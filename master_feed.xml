<p>The Unitree R1 is a cost-effective, ultra-lightweight, and customizable humanoid robot that stands 1.21m tall and weighs approximately 25kg in its default configuration. The company says pricing starts at $5,900, which is considerably cheaper than the company&#8217;s G1 humanoid robot or Elephant Robotics&#8217; Mercuxy X1 wheeled humanoid robot, both of which go for about $16,000 and up. Some cost-cutting measures had to be taken for the lower price, including a slightly shorter design and missing features like working hands&#8230; Let&#8217;s check out the specifications for more details.

<p>THIRDREALITY Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1 may look like a traditional mechanical keyboard, but it supports the Matter protocol to double as a Smart Home controller. I initially thought it was a ridiculous idea, but as someone who spends 8 hours or more a day in front of a keyboard, it could be quite convenient. Simply press the F1 to F12 keys to control lights, adjust air conditioners, smart shades, and more with minimal distraction. So let&#8217;s have a look at the MK1 in more detail. Smart Mechanical Keyboard MK1 specifications: Model Number &#8211; 3RMK01069M Wireless connectivity Matter over Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz only, 5GHz not supported) Compatible Devices &#8211; Apple Home, Home Assistant, SmartThings, and Google Home (and likely other Matter-certified hubs with Wi-Fi connectivity) Likely based on Bouffalo Lab BL602 chip (See Home Assistant screenshot below).

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>The Raspberry Pi RP2350 dual-core Arm/RISC-V has gotten a new version &#8211; A4 stepping &#8211; addressing bugs and security vulnerabilities, notably the infamous E9 GPIO erratum and glitching bugs in the A2 stepping identified by the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Both RP2350A and RP2350B variants will benefit from the new stepping and be marked RP2350A0A4 and RP2350B0A4, respectively. The company also announced the availability of the 2MB flash variants, the RP2354A and RP2354B (unveiled in March 2025), that do not require flash on the board. RP2350 A4 stepping highlights: Fixes Glitching bugs identified in the 2024 Hacking Challenge. Exploits required physical access to the chip. The E9 GPIO erratum related to GPIO pull-ups. A4 stepping is a drop-in replacement for the earlier A2 stepping. 5V-tolerant GPIOs; Note: the chip must remain powered while 5V IOs are used (See updated datasheet for details) RP2354A and RP2354B variants with 2MB of stacked-in-package QSPI [...]</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.16 on LKML: It&#8217;s Sunday afternoon, and the release cycle has come to an end. Last week was nice and calm, and there were no big show-stopper surprises to keep us from the regular schedule, so I&#8217;ve tagged and pushed out 6.16 as planned. It&#8217;s worth noting that the upcoming merge window for 6.17 is going to be slightly chaotic for me: I have multiple family events this August (a wedding and a big birthday), and with said family being spread not only across the US, but in Finland too, I&#8217;m spending about half the month traveling. That means that I will try very hard to get most of the merge window done the first week before my travels start, and I already ended upgiving a heads-up on that to the people who tend to send me the most pull requests.

<p>AutoML for Embedded, developed by Analog Devices (ADI) and Antmicro, is an open-source plugin for Visual Studio Code that works alongside ADI’s CodeFusion Studio plugin. Built on the Kenning framework, it automates the full ML pipeline, including model search, hyperparameter tuning, optimization, compression, and deployment, making edge AI development easy on resource-constrained devices. The company mentions that it supports the ADI MAX78002 AI accelerator MCU, the MAX32690 MCU, Renode-based simulation, and Zephyr RTOS. It uses SMAC and Hyperband algorithms for automated model search and hyperparameter tuning, along with model compression and quantization to meet strict memory and compute limits. The plugin offers built-in benchmarking for inference speed, memory footprint, and accuracy, while performing RAM and compute compatibility checks. All these features make it useful for applications like image classification, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, NLP, and action recognition on low-power IoT and embedded systems.

<p>Will Whang&#8217;s RPI5-SDexpress-Hat is a small HAT+ for the Raspberry Pi 5, adding a microSD Express card slot for ultrafast storage, an eject button, and two Qwiic connectors, probably because there was still some spare space on the board&#8230; As a reminder, microSD Express cards can deliver SSD performance thanks to the use of of PCIe interface and NVMe commands. The standard was first introduced in 2019, and even earlier (2018) for full-size SD cards, but manufacturers have not exactly rushed to release compatible hardware. A major change this year is the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 portable game console, one of the first mass market devices with a microSD Express slot, and this was partially why Will created the microSD Express HAT+ for the Raspberry Pi 5.

<p>Bosch Sensortech BME690 8x shuttle board is a sensor board comprised of eight identical BM690 4-in-1 gas/temperature/humidity/pressure sensors capable of monitoring indoor air quality and detecting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs), and other gases. The obvious question is &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Why would a board need 8 identical sensors?&#8221;. The board flyer isn&#8217;t overly specific: &#8230; the shuttle board can be used to evaluate the signal outputs provided by the sensor itself as well as the additional outputs generated by the BSEC library for BME690 So let&#8217;s try to understand, starting with the specification from the BME690 sensor.

<p>We&#8217;ve just written about the Ugoos X5M Pro as one of the first Amlogic S905X5M TV boxes, but the market is expanding, and Xiaomi TV Stick 4K (2nd Gen) Google TV dongle is now available as a smaller version of the company&#8217;s Xiaomi TV Box S (3rd Gen) based on the same or similar processor. The TV stick features 2GB RAM, 8GB eMMC flash, a 4K-capable HDMI male port, and WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, and not much else, as one would expect from an HDMI TV stick. It ships with a Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant voice commands. The company did not list the exact part number of the processor, and while it matches the Amlogic S905X5M specifications, it should be another model without Ethernet support, like Amlogic did in the past with the S905Y4, so maybe an S905Y5M?

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>
