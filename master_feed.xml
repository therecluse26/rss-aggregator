<p>People are trying to run LLMs on all sorts of low-end hardware with often limited usefulness, and when I saw a solar LLM over Meshtastic demo on X, I first laughed. I did not see the reason for it and LoRa hardware is usually really low-end with Meshtastic open-source firmware typically used for off-grid messaging and GPS location sharing. But after thinking more about it, it could prove useful to receive information through mobile devices during disasters where power and internet connectivity can not be taken for granted. Let&#8217;s check Colonel Panic&#8217;s solution first. The short post only mentions it&#8217;s a solar LLM over Meshtastic using M5Stack hardware. On the left, we must have a power bank charge over USB (through a USB solar panel?) with two USB outputs powering a controller and a board on the right. The main controller with a small display and enclosure is an ESP32-powered [...]</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.1.1  has just been released with official 200 MHz clock support for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU, several new boards mostly from Waveshare, but also one from Sparkfun, as well as new code samples, and other small changes. Raspberry Pi RP2040 gets official 200 MHz clock support When the Raspberry Pi RP2040 was first released along with Raspberry Pi Pico in 2021, we were told the default frequency was 48 MHz, but the microcontroller could also run up to 133 MHz. Eventually, I think the Cortex-M0+ cores were clocked at 125 MHz by default, although some projects (e.g. PicoDVI) would boost the frequency up to 252 MHz. Frequencies higher than 133 Mhz were not officially supported so far, but the Pico SDK 2.1.1 changes that since the Raspberry Pi RP2040 has now been certified to run at a system clock of 200MHz when using a [...]</p>

<p>Youtuber and tech enthusiast Binh Pham has recently built a portable plug-and-play AI and LLM device housed in a USB stick called the LLMStick and built around a Raspberry Pi Zero W. This device portrays the concept of a local plug-and-play LLM which you can use without the internet. After DeepSeek shook the world with its performance and open-source accessibility, we have seen tools like Exo that allow you to run large language models (LLMs) on a cluster of devices, like computers, smartphones, and single-board computers, effectively distributing the processing load. We have also seen Radxa release instructions to run DeepSeek R1 (Qwen2 1.5B) on a Rockchip RK3588-based SBC with 6 TOPS NPU. Pham thought of using the llama.cpp project as it&#8217;s specifically designed for devices with limited resources. However, running llama.cpp on the Raspberry Pi Zero W wasn&#8217;t straightforward and he had to face architecture incompatibility as the old [...]</p>

<p>Kontron 3.5&#8243;-SBC-AML/ADN is a 3.5-inch single board computer powered by either Intel Amston Lake (Industrial grade) or Alder Lake-N (commercial grade) processor and designed for applications such as automation, healthcare, smart city, and smart retail. It builds upon the smaller Kontron 2.5”-SBC-AML/ADN Pico-ITX SBC with many of the same features, but replaces eMMC flash storage with an M.2 SATA/NVMe socket and a SATA connector, features DDR5 SO-DIMM memory instead of soldered-on LPDDR5, and the larger PCB size allows it to gain an extra DisplayPort connector, a USB 2.0 Type-A port, additional serial ports, and a board-to-board (B2B) connector for expansion. It also supports a wider 9 to 36V DC range. Kontron 3.5&#8243;-SBC-AML/ADN specifications: SoC Standard Intel Atom x7211RE dual-core processor up to 3.2GHz with 6MB cache, 16EU Intel UHD graphics; TDP: 6W Intel Atom x7433RE quad-core processor up to 3.4GHz with 6MB cache, 32EU Intel UHD graphics; TDP: 9W Intel [...]</p>

<p>ESPHome is the favorite open-source firmware of Smart Home devices, but Tasmota is another option that&#8217;s been available for many years. We&#8217;ve just seen fewer products based on Tasmota (previously Sonoff-Tasmota) in recent years, but it recently showed up on a credit card-sized quad relay board, and I&#8217;ve just come across Maker Go&#8217;s Xcrhom T4S WiFi Outdoor Smart Socket that also ships with Tasmota firmware and sells on AliExpress for $24.88 shipped. The Xcrhom T4S exposes two sockets with dust and rainproof covers to be used safely outdoors, integrates a power meter, and the Tasmota firmware enables MQTT support, Home Assistant compatibility, and support for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

<p>Connections between chips have become increasingly complex, and applications with higher frequency and speed requirements may not make use of traditional PCB technology. That&#8217;s where the interposer PCB, a new type of PCB comes into play. PCBWay has the capability to manufacture high-layer, high-order PCBs, and even successfully developed a 24-layer, 6-order arbitrary interconnection HDI PCB. The interposer PCB is a highly precise, high-density interconnect (HDI) PCB that allows for a higher wiring density per unit area compared to traditional PCBs. HDI PCBs are characterized by features such as micro vias, finer lines and spaces, higher connection pad density, and the use of blind and buried vias.

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

<p>You&#8217;d typically need hardware with a large amount of memory and bandwidth and multiple GPUs, if you want to run the latest large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek R1 with 671 billion parameters. But such hardware is not affordable or even available to most people, and the Exo software works around that as a distributed LLM solution working on a cluster of computers with or without NVIDIA GPUs, smartphones, and/or single board computers like Raspberry Pi boards. In some ways, exo works like distcc when compiling C programs over a build farm, but targets AI workloads such as LLMs instead. Key features of Exo software: Support for LLaMA (MLX and tinygrad), Mistral, LlaVA, Qwen, and Deepseek.

<p>Beagleboard has recently announced the PocketBeagle 2, a single board computer (SBC) built around TI&#8217;s AM6232 dual-core Cortex-A53 and Cortex-M7 SoC and an additional MSPM0L1105 Arm Cortex-M0+ microcontroller for ADC pins and board ID storage. Designed for developers, students, and hobbyists, it&#8217;s a direct upgrade from the previous generation PocketBeagle which the company released in 2017. The new board comes with a faster dual-core 64-bit CPU (compared to a single-core CPU), faster memory (DDR4), improved power management (USB-C + LiPo charger), and easier debugging (UART + JTAG) for faster development. Additionally, it comes with four user-controllable LEDs, a power LED, and a battery-charging LED for better status indication. Unlike the first generation, this new version comes with pre-soldered GPIO headers with the same compact (55 x 35mm) form factor making it suitable for embedded applications and IoT projects.

<p>SPOKE is a Raspberry Pi RP2040-based capacitive touch sensor board for interactive computer interfaces. It is designed to simplify the integration of touch-based control into various projects. SPOKE features up to 27 sensor inputs and can “turn almost any conductive material into a sensor” to control almost any computer input. Potential applications include music making, video game controlling, typing, and general software controlling. The board was designed by Tom Fox, an educator, maker, and musician in the UK. According to him, the board is accessible to beginners getting started with touch sensing while retaining enough power and customizability for professional use. It works with several conductive materials, including copper pipes, conductive paint, aluminum foil, pencils, conductive filaments, fruits, fabrics with conductive threads, and metallic surfaces. It can also be used with a non-conductive material (such as plywood) if a conductive material (e.g. tinfoil) is behind it. The fully-featured SPOKE capacitive [...]</p>

<p>Waveshare has recently released the RoArm-M3-Pro and RoArm-M3-S, a 5+1 DOF high-torque ESP32 robotic arm kit. The main difference between the two is that the RoArm-M3-Pro features all-metal ST3235 bus servos for durability and longevity, on the other hand, the RoArm-M3-S uses standard servo motors which are less durable for long-term use. These robotic arms feature a lightweight structure, a 360° omnidirectional base, and five flexible joints, which together create a 1m workspace with a 200 grams @ 0.5m payload. A 2-DOF wrist joint enables multi-dimensional clamping and precise force control. It integrates an ESP32 MCU, supporting multiple wireless control modes via a web app, it also supports inverse kinematics for accurate positioning, curve velocity control for smooth motion, and adaptive force control. The design is open source and with ROS2 compatibility, it allows secondary development via JSON commands and ESP-NOW for multi-device communication.

<p>We will be reviewing a smart home device from SONOFF that we recently received right after the New Year, the SONOFF SwitchMan Zigbee Smart Wall (ZBM5). This is SONOFF&#8217;s first Zigbee-enabled Smart Wall Switch. In addition to functioning as a smart wall switch, it can also act as a Zigbee Router, making it easier to expand your Zigbee network at home in one shot. One of the key features of the SONOFF ZBM5 is that it can either operate in with-neutral (N) or without-neutral (N) wiring setups. Typically, in the market, we see these as separate models: one for with-neutral and another for without-neutral. This feature adds more flexibility for users, especially those with wiring constraints in their homes. Let’s dive into the details. SONOFF ZBM5 Unboxing Inside the box, you&#8217;ll find a user manual, wall plugs, and the switch itself. The model we received has a rectangular shape (120mm) [...]</p>

<p>Makerfabs has recently released &#8220;MaTouch SmartKnob Assembled&#8221; based on the SmartKnob View open-source hardware design but enclosed in a plastic case. As a reminder, the SmartKnob View is an ESP32-S3-based DIY rotary knob built around a BLDC motor. With clever software and engineering, the motor is so configured that it can do software configurable detents, haptic feedback, magnetic encoder, and more. It also has a round LCD touchscreen, and USB-C, and features a convenient 3D enclosure that can also be attached to your wall with some sticky pull tabs. The SmartKnob View was a great concept, but its DIY nature made it difficult for many people to get their hands on one as it was never manufactured in quantities. The MaTouch SmartKnob Assembled solves this issue by building upon the original design and comes fully assembled for immediate use. The original module integrates a 240&#215;240 round LCD and uses an [...]</p>

<p>Leon Böttger's GoogleFindMyTools is a re-implementation of Google's Find My Device network. It works with Android devices and commercial trackers, but experimental support for ESP32-based trackers has recently been added.</p>
<p>The implementation features two components. First, the main.py Python script that will list and locate devices, and then the ESP32 firmware implemented in C with the ESP-IDF. The host computer will also need several Python libraries that can be installed with "pip install -r requirements.txt" and Google Chrome web browser.</p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>

<p>Sequent Microsystems’ &#8220;Eight 24-bit ADC 8-layer Stackable HAT&#8221; is a Raspberry Pi expansion board designed for home automation projects. It is compatible with all Raspberry Pi models with a 40-pin GPIO header and features a stackable design that provides scalability for more complex setups. It includes eight independent 24-bit ADC channels, providing ultra-high resolution for measuring small analog signals accurately. It also features programmable gain amplifiers on each input channel for amplifying weak signals and optimizing the ADC’s input range. It is stackable up to eight layers, allowing for up to 64 differential analog inputs. It provides 4A continuous and 5A peak power to the Raspberry Pi via the GPIO header. It sends data via the I2C lines, leaving all other pins free for use. Also, it supports isolated RS485 communication for long-distance connectivity. The 8-layer Stackable HAT for Raspberry Pi is suitable for precision data acquisition applications, including industrial [...]</p>

<p>I swear it&#8217;s not an AI-generated picture of a device, but the Mekotronics R58-PTZ is real and just another unusual Rockchip RK3588 hardware platform from the company that&#8217;s an embedded computer with a 3-inch display on the front panel and a PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera placed on top. Mekotronics describes it as a live-streaming box designed for video surveillance, so I assume its main use case is to leverage to built-in 6 TOPS NPU for live streaming with some real-time effect and/or surveillance applications detecting persons, masks, etc&#8230; especially it also offers two HDMI inputs for extra cameras.

<p>The Raspberry Pi 5 brought a more powerful CPU and GPU and faster I/Os compared to the Raspberry Pi 4, as well as some incompatibilities. While the transition from a Raspberry Pi 4 to a Raspberry Pi 5 is usually painless for most applications, Adafruit notes that the ability to drive HUB75 RGB LED matrices was lost on the Raspberry Pi 5 which now relies on the Raspberry Pi RP1 peripheral control to drive GPIOs instead of the Broadcom processor directly controlling them. The company has now addressed that by using the PIO (Programmable I/O) block in the RP1 chip, yes that&#8217;s the same PIOs as found in the RP2040 or RP2350 microcontroller, to drive HUB75 RGB LED matrices from the Raspberry Pi 5, and their work can be found on the Adafruit-Blinka-Raspberry-Pi5-Piomatter repository on GitHub.

<p>While there are plenty of ESP32-based wireless-controlled robot cars with a built-in camera, like the PiCar-X 2.0 or Zeus Car, it might be more fun and rewarding to build something yourself. That&#8217;s exactly what Matt Sroufe did by building his own RC car using off-the-shelf parts and an ESP32-CAM board and writing firmware for it. To get started with the build, you&#8217;ll need six main components: A 4-wheel car chassis &#8211; $47.49 on AliExpress Electronic speed controller  &#8211; $5.27 on AliExpress. Matt selected the 30A version with green PCB. Dual-battery holder for about $2 on AliExpress 2x 18650 3.6V cells or 7.4V batteries purchased locally ESP32-CAM board with an external antenna and the 160° FoV camera &#8211; About $14 with board, camera, and external antenna.

<p>FlashMyPico website allows you to write C code, build the firmware, and flash it to your Raspberry Pi Pico, Pico W, Pico 2, or Pico 2 W directly from a web browser instead of having to check out the code from GitHub, build it in a terminal, and then manually copy the resulting binary. I&#8217;ve given it a quick with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 board. The first step is to head over to flashmypico.com from your computer or even an Android smartphone. You&#8217;ll need a web browser that supports WebUSB, so for example, Firefox is not an option, and I eventually had to use Google Chrome instead. There&#8217;s a detect device link on the bottom left, so I clicked on that first, and my Raspberry Pi Pico 2 was detected as &#8220;RP2350 Boot&#8221; after I put it in bootloader mode.

            <p>RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I'm in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.</p>

<p>From my first tests on the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive 2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth, fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.</p>

<p>The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn't have a <em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including llama.cpp and Ollama!</p>

<p>Deepseek, a new AI startup run by a Chinese hedge fund, <em>allegedly</em> created a new open weights model called R1 that beats OpenAI's best model in every metric.</p>

<p>Apple charges $800 to upgrade from the base model M4 Mac mini's 256 GB of internal storage to a more capacious 2 TB.</p>

<p>Pictured above is a photo of a standard 2230-size M.2 NVMe SSD (one made by Raspberry Pi, in this case), and Apple's proprietary <em>not-M.2</em> drive, which has NAND flash chips on it, but no <em>NVM Express controller</em>, the 'brains' in a little chip that lets NVMe SSDs work universally across any computer with a standard M.2 PCIe slot.</p>

            <p></p>

<p>A couple years ago, after I heard about the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite-rpi-hat">CaribouLite on CrowdSupply</a>, I pre-ordered one.</p>

<p>I've dabbled in SDR with an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ckxh5d">RTL-SDR v3</a> for a few years, even <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/hospital-stay-and-mlb-blackouts-led-me-rtl-sdr-radio">using one with nrsc5 to listen to baseball games OTA</a> because of silly MLB blackout restrictions.</p>

<p>But low-cost SDRs like the RTL-SDR v3 are receive-only, and have a limited frequency range, and lower quality RF filtering, so it can be frustrating if you're trying to work with lower-power RF... or trying to transmit at all!</p>

<p><code>top</code> (pictured <em>below</em>... above is <a href="#btop">btop</a>) is the first utility everyone recommends to monitor Linux (or any form of UNIX, including macOS) resource usage. It's efficient, available almost everywhere... but it's also a bit basic. It shows essential metrics, but looks like it's from the 80s. There are ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing color schemes, but it's not the only game in town!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools—and some not so modern, but immensely useful—to choose from. This blog post will run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the comments if you use any others I didn't cover!</p>
