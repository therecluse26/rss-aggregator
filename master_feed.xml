<p>Waveshare MK20 is a multifunctional macro keyboard with twenty mechanical keys featuring 0.85-inch LCD keycaps. As an upgrade to the earlier MK10 model, it adds a 2.8-inch secondary display along with two control knobs. The device supports AI voice interaction, real-time data display, and smart home integration with Home Assistant. Like its predecessor, the MK20 relies on a dual-system architecture: an Allwinner T113-S3 dual-core Cortex-A7 processor runs Linux to drive the displays, and a GD32 microcontroller runs QMK for low-latency keyboard and knob input. Each LCD key offers 128&#215;128 resolution and supports dynamic images, videos, and multi-layer overlays, while the 2.8-inch secondary display (428 × 142 resolution) provides status or customization information. The keyboard also includes two rotary encoders with aluminum caps for volume, playback, or timeline control. The device is built with an aluminum alloy top case and a 2.5D acrylic lens for durability. Waveshare MK20 specifications: Main Controller – Allwinner [...]</p>

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p></div>

<p>The MIPI Alliance has recently released the SoundWire I3S (MIPI SWI3S v1.0) specification for high-bandwidth, low-latency audio applications which unify control and data over a single, power-efficient interface. SWI3S builds upon the two-pin, multi-drop architecture of MIPI SoundWire released in 2014, and offers higher bandwidth, low power consumption, much better noise immunity, and support for scalable multi-device topologies to meet the increasing requirements of embedded audio systems. MIPI SWI3S v1.0 supports data rates up to 76 Mbps against 24 Mbps for the earlier SLIMbus and SoundWire audio interfaces, and improves noise immunity by operating in &#8220;forwarded clock&#8221; or &#8220;differential low voltage signaling&#8221;. It also implements a range of new features such as Hubs, multiple PHY support, control CRC, power-saving techniques, and more. MIPI SoundWire I3S key features: Transports audio data, control commands, interrupt signals, and synchronization information over a unified two-pin link Forwarded bit clock single-ended (FBCSE) and differential low-voltage [...]</p>
