            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>If you were 5 microseconds late today, blame it on NIST.</p>

<p>Their facility in Boulder Colorado just had its power cut for multiple days. After a backup generator failed, their main ensemble clock lost track of UTC, or Universal Time Coordinated.</p>

<p>But even if you used the <a href="https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi">NTP timing servers they run</a>, they were never off by more than 5 microseconds.</p>

<p>5 μs might seem insignificant. But it <em>is</em> significant for scientists and universities who rely on NIST's more <a href="https://wsts.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04-Judah-Levine.The-NIST-Fiber-Based-Time-Service.pdf">specialized timing signals</a>.</p>

<p>But no, you don't need to panic. And yes, they have it under control now.</p>

<p>But I thought I'd go over what happened, what it means, and what we can learn from NIST's near-outage.</p>

With Linux 6.19, the GCN 1.0/1.1 GPUs are now defaulting to the modern AMDGPU kernel driver in place of the legacy "Radeon" DRM driver that has been the default for GCN 1.1/1.0 and other ATI/AMD graphics processors of the past 2+ decades.

<p>ESP-Scope is an open-source firmware transforming any ESP32 board into an oscilloscope using one of the ADC pins up to 83,333 Hz sample rate (on the ESP32-C6) and visualizing the results over Wi-Fi in a web browser, be it Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or others. It&#8217;s not the first ESP32 oscilloscope project we&#8217;ve seen, as last year, we covered Bojan Jurca’s “Esp32_oscilloscope” Arduino sketch doing something very similar. The ESP-Scope is a little different, since it&#8217;s based on the ESP-IDF framework, and was used to test AI code generators, specifically &#8220;Google Antigravity using Gemini 3, with refinements, hints and tips and overall design specified by a human&#8221;. It just took a few hours to build. ESP-Score firmware features: Real-time signal visualization on a web browser. Adjustable sample rate (1-83333 Hz) and attenuation.

<p>Seeed Studio sent us a review sample of the XIAO Soil Moisture Sensor powered by the XIAO ESP32C6 wireless module and running on a single AA battery. Designed for ultra-low power consumption, it&#8217;s supposed to offer long-lasting operation with dynamic adjustment of monitoring intervals. It&#8217;s preloaded with ESPHome firmware and is fully compatible with Home Assistant. It&#8217;s ideal for indoor plants monitoring, but it can&#8217;t be used outdoors since the 3D printed enclosure is not weatherproof.

<p>Ever since I got <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/using-amd-gpus-on-raspberry-pi-without-recompiling-linux">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/all-intel-gpus-run-on-raspberry-pi-and-risc-v">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia</a> graphics cards to run on a Raspberry Pi, I had a nagging question:</p>

<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s. Not a fair fight.</p></div>

<p>While most people use Linux on Arm SBCs, it&#8217;s typically possible to run Windows 11 on Arm boards with UEFI support, but with caveats such as the GPU and VPU not working and other issues. One solution is to avoid the Arm architecture altogether and go with an x86 SBC like the Radxa X4, ODROID-H4+, or LattePanda IOTA, among others. But things may change for the better now that Qualcomm SBCs are becoming a thing, and Radxa has just announced official Windows support for the Radxa Dragon Q6A. Note that it is only a preview image for now.

<p>Just a few months back, Wireless-Tag released the WT99P4C5-S1, which combines the ESP32-P4 with an ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 module, instead of the more commonly used ESP32-C6 wireless module found on most ESP32-P4 development boards we’ve covered. The company has now released the WTDKP4C5-S1, a more compact development board built around the WT01P4C5-S1 ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C5 core module. The board supports MIPI-CSI and MIPI-DSI through the ESP32-P4, while the SDIO-connected ESP32-C5 provides dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (2.4/5 GHz) connectivity along with BLE 5, Zigbee, Thread, and Matter. Other features include a USB 2.0 Type-C OTG port, two UART debug interfaces, two 40-pin GPIO breakouts from both chips, and various power options via USB-C, a 12V DC input, or headers. The board is suitable for LVGL-based HMIs, data acquisition, industrial control, and Edge AI applications such as IPCs and smart displays.

<p>Maxell PSB2032 is a rechargeable &#8220;all-solid-state&#8221; coin cell battery for industrial IoT devices, which more than quadruples the capacity of the earlier PSB401010H ceramic-packaged solid-state battery, increasing it from 8mAh to 35mAh. As its name implies, it measures 20 mm in diameter and 3.2 mm in height, and delivers key benefits of solid-state batteries such as a wide discharge temperature range, high reliability, and high safety. It&#8217;s also easier to install than ceramic-packaged batteries requiring reflow soldering, since it comes pre-equipped with two connection terminals suitable for mounting into small-sized devices. The company shared a comparison table between its two solid-state batteries. For reference, the capacity of a typical CR2032 battery is 220–240 mAh, so the PSB2032 has a much lower capacity. However, it can be recharged and works in demanding environments with a wide temperature range and high safety requirements. The last time we wrote about solid-state batteries was [...]</p>

<p>Seeed Studio sent us samples of the reTerminal E1001 (monochrome) and E1002 (color) ePaper displays for review. They are powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller providing WiFi and Bluetooth LE wireless connectivity, and are designed for low-power information display applications, consuming power only when updating the screen content. This makes them ideal for tasks requiring long battery life (average of 3 months per charge, depending on how often they are updated) and always-on display capabilities. In this review, we will unbox the devices, go through a teardown, and test them with Seeed Studio&#8217;s SenseCraft no-code HMI platform, as well as ESPHome firmware for Home Assistant integration. reTerminal E1001/E1002 unboxing We received two cardboard packages that look identical and are labeled &#8220;Seeed Studio reTerminal ePaper Display&#8221;.

<p>There are plenty of e-book readers on the market, but the Diptyx E-Reader feels more like a proper book since it features two e-paper displays that can be folded or opened thanks to a custom-made plastic enclosure. While it&#8217;s powered by an ESP32-S3 wireless module with a PCB antenna, both WiFi and Bluetooth are disabled in the firmware, and instead, users can load EPUB files through the reader&#8217;s USB Type-C port. The combination of an automatic standby mode (using deep sleep) and e-ink displays enables the dual-screen device to run for weeks on a single charge. Two buttons are used to access the next or previous page, and a third one powers the device up in a few seconds.

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>

<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>

<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to review three Intel-based UP AI development kits running Ubuntu 24.04 Pro. Last time, I tested the UP TWL SBC with Nx Meta and UP AI Toolkit, and most AI workloads would pass, but since these were running on the Intel N150 CPU or GPU, the performance was not optimal for most. I&#8217;ll now switch to the UP Squared Pro TWL &#8220;mid-range&#8221; AI devkit review with another Intel Processor N150 SBC fitted with a 13 TOPS Hailo-8L M.2 AI accelerator. Both the UP TWL and UP Squared Pro TWL come with a 64GB eMMC flash, and I found out it was rather tight since AI software and models can take a lot of space. The UP Squared Pro TWL has a few M.2 sockets, so I&#8217;ll install an NVMe SSD to expand storage before installing the UP AI toolkit. As usual, I’ll run a few benchmarks and [...]</p>

<p>I have a Raspberry Pi and an Nvidia graphics card—and I'm easily distracted. So I put down my testing of a GB10 system for a bit, and compiled mariobalanica's branch.</p></div>

<p>This air quality monitor costs $250. It's called the <a href="https://networkedartifacts.com/airlab">Air Lab</a>, and I've been using it to measure the air in my car, home, studio, and a few events over the past few months. And in using it over the course of a road trip I learned to not run recirculate in my car quite as often—more on that later.</p>
