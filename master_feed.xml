In this short review, I&#8217;ll go through an unboxing, before testing the features with a smartphone, and trying to stress it a little with five devices, including a laptop, a USB-C powered HDMI display, a wireless display, an Android smartphone, and a Raspberry Pi 5 SBC.

<p>Jetway B420UADN1 is a compact Intel N97 fanless mini PC designed for kiosks and digital signage applications with support for up to three independent 4K displays through four display interfaces: HDMI, DisplayPort, and two USB-C with DP Alt mode. At first, I thought we had already covered it since the Jetway B420PADN1 embedded box PC has a similar design, but it only comes with one HDMI port. The new B420UADN1 fanless mini PC also supports DDR5 SO-DIMM memory and M.2 NVMe or SATA storage, and offers two 2.5GbE ports, optional WiFi/Bluetooth support, a 3.5mm audio jack, a few USB 3.2/2.0 Type-A ports, and an RS-232/442/485 COM port for peripherals like barcode readers. Jetway B420UADN1 specifications: SoC &#8211; Intel Processor N97 quad-core Alder Lake-N CPU @ up to 3.6 GHz with 6MB cache, 24 EU Intel UHD graphics @ up to 1.20 GHz; TDP: 12W System Memory &#8211;  Up to 32GB [...]</p>

<p>One interesting addition to the just-released Linux 6.18 kernel is the Tyr Rust GPU driver for CSF-based Arm Mali GPUs, which is a port of the mature Panthor C GPU driver merged into Linux 6.10. It was developed by Collabora in collaboration with Arm and Google. Tyr aims to implement the same userspace API offered by Panthor, so that it can eventually be used as a drop-in replacement in the company&#8217;s PanVK Vulkan driver. After several years, the Tyr Rust driver might replace the Panthor C driver, but in the meantime, Panthor will keep being used since it is more mature and conformant with OpenGL ES 3.1 since July 2024. The work on Tyr is fairly advanced, and Collabora provided an update at the end of November. The key takeaway is that the Tyr (prototype) driver works with  GNOME, Weston, and even full-screen 3D games like SuperTuxKart while matching the [...]</p>

<p>Last October, Raspberry Pi had to increase the price of its CM4/CM5 Compute Modules due to DDR4 supply constraints. Now the company has had to do the same for the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 single board computers, and launched the Raspberry Pi 5 1GB for people wanting a lower cost option. They could not get the traditional $35 price tag, and the new low-cost Pi 5 sells for $45. Here&#8217;s what the old and new prices are. $145 for a Raspberry Pi 5 16GB starts to be really stiff, especially since that&#8217;s only the board we are talking about here. Other casualties are 16GB variants of the Compute Module 5, which got a price increase of $20 after being spared by the October price adjustments. The cheapest Pi 4/5 option &#8211; the Raspberry Pi 4 1GB &#8211; is still sold for $35. It&#8217;s not in the table above as [...]</p>

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.18 on the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), which will likely become the next LTS kernel [update: it&#8217;s now official]: So I&#8217;ll have to admit that I&#8217;d have been happier with slightly less bugfixing noise in this last week of the release, but while there&#8217;s a few more fixes than I would hope for, there was nothing that made me feel like this needs more time to cook. So 6.18 is tagged and pushed out. Most of the last-minute fixes are minor fixes to drivers, with some random noise elsewhere (bluetooth, ceph, afs..). Nothing strikes me as standing out, but hey, there&#8217;s a shortlog appended if you want to see the details. And this obviously means that the merge window will open tomorrow, and I already have three dozen pull requests pending. Thanks. And as I already mentioned a couple of [...]</p>

<p>Chen Liang (陳亮) has found an interesting use case for the Espressif ESP32-C5: a dual-band Wi-Fi analyzer showing the signal strength of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi access points in your area. It works like one of the Wi-Fi analyzer apps on your phone, except it relies on an ESP32-C5 board and a display support for the Arduino_GFX libraries, for example, based on the ILI9341 driver, as it&#8217;s easier for beginners since the code does not need to be changed. Here&#8217;s what it looks like. You can follow the instructions provided by Chen to reproduce the setup. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward. He specifically used an ESP32-C5-DevkitC-1 board (or one of the clones) along with an ILI9341 display (not sure about the exact model, but any should do) and wired them together using a breadboard as shown in the photo below. You&#8217;ll then need to fire up the Arduino IDE, install Arduino [...]</p>

<p>Banana Pi BPI-CM6 system-on-module (SoM) is powered by a SpacemiT K1 octa-core RISC-V processor and compatible with most carrier boards for the Raspberry Pi CM4 or CM5 modules. It ships with 8GB LPDDR4 and 16GB eMMC flash by default, a Gigabit Ethernet PHY, and a WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.1 wireless module. It exposes most interfaces through three 100-pin board-to-board connectors with HDMI 1.4, MIPI DSI, three MIPI CSI, five PCIe 2.1 lanes, USB 3.2/2.0 interfaces, and more. While it can work with Raspberry Pi CM4/CM5 carrier boards using two of the B2B connectors, the company also designed the BPI-CM6 IO carrier board to make full use of all the interfaces, especially the PCIe lanes. Banana Bi BPI-CM6 SoM Let&#8217;s check the module itself first.

<p>Waveshare has launched a low-cost LG290P breakout board priced at about half the competing options. It supports L1/L2/L5/E6 quad-band GNSS with centimeter-level RTK positioning for robotics, surveying, precision agriculture, and other high-accuracy applications. The board supports GPS, BDS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS, and NavIC reception, along with SBAS systems such as WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, BDSBAS, GAGAN, and SDCM. It offers RTK rover/base functionality with &#60;5-second convergence, raw observation output, 10–20 Hz navigation rates, and strong anti-interference performance thanks to its integrated narrow-band jamming detection and cancellation. The module features a USB-C port for power and UART-to-USB communication, castellated pads for easy integration, an RTC battery connector for faster TTFF, and onboard status LEDs. Waveshare LG290P breakout board specifications: GNSS module – Quectel LG290P GNSS Frequency bands GPS – L1 C/A, L1C, L5, L2C GLONASS – L1, L2 Galileo – E1, E5a, E5b, E6 BDS – B1I, B1C, B2a, B2b, B2I, B3I QZSS [...]</p>

<p>While the hot dog's flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"><em>Amplitude</em> Modulation</a>, where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down. Just like a speaker cone moving up and down, the plasma arc from the hot dog turns that modulation into audible sound.</p></div>
