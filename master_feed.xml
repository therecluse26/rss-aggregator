<p>Orange Pi AI Studio is a mini PC designed for artificial intelligence applications, equipped with up to two Huawei Ascend 310 AI octa-core ARM 64-bit processors, delivering up to 176 TOPS per chip, as well as up to 192GB RAM. This follows the Orange Pi AIPro introduced last year, with an unnamed Huawei Ascend SoC delivering up to 20 TOPS NPU. The basic version of AI Studio has up to 96GB of LPDDR4X memory and 32MB of SPI Flash. The interface of the device is very simple, featuring a 12V 10A DC power interface, a USB 4.0 Type-C port, a power switch, and an indicator light. The only disadvantage is the limited number of ports provided, even do not include an HDMI port or an Ethernet port.

Now for Linux 6.18, the Bcachefs code was removed from the mainline kernel...]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Sep 2025 23:54:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TekaSketch: Where Etch A Sketch Meets Graph Theory</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/09/29/tekasketch-where-etch-a-sketch-meets-graph-theory/</link><description><![CDATA[<div><img width="800" height="450" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?w=800" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Two hands working a TekaSketch" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 15px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg 1200w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?resize=250,141 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?resize=400,225 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?resize=800,450 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-attachment-id="835021" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2025/09/29/tekasketch-where-etch-a-sketch-meets-graph-theory/etch-a-sketch-1200/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg" data-orig-size="1200,675" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="etch-a-sketch-1200" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/etch-a-sketch-1200.jpg?w=800" /></div>The Etch A Sketch was never supposed to meet a Raspberry Pi, a camera, or a mathematical algorithm, but here we are.

<p>Linux 6.17 has just been released on LKML: No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go. Below is the shortlog for just the last week &#8211; not the full 6.17 release &#8211; as usual. It&#8217;s not exciting, which is all good. I think the biggest patch in there is some locking fixes for some bluetooth races that could cause use-after-free situations. Whee &#8211; that&#8217;s about as exciting as it gets. Other than that, there&#8217; the usual driver fixlets (GPU and networking dominate as usual, but &#8220;dominate&#8221; is still pretty small), there&#8217;s some minor random other driver updates, some filesystem noise, and core kernel and mm. And some selftest updates. This obviously means that the merge window for 6.18 will open tomorrow, and I already have four dozen pull requests pending. Thanks to the proactive people &#8211; you know who [...]</p>

<p>LUNYEE has sent us a review sample of the 4040 PRO CNC router, featuring a larger work volume than the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra model we reviewed a few months ago. It is designed for milling and engraving tasks that demand high precision and features a robust structure to support continuous operation. It works with wood, plastic, and acrylic. Its standout feature is the complete set of accessories, such as the Probe system for Z-axis setup and a workpiece clamping kit, allowing users to get started right away. This makes it an ideal CNC Router for beginners in engraving work. We&#8217;ve previously reviewed the smaller 3018 Pro Ultra with Easel, but we&#8217;ll instead use Candle software on the 4040 PRO machine.

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from cloud-first architectures to edge-first designs, so more processing now runs on phones, cameras, and embedded controllers. Running inference on-device cuts latency and keeps sensitive data local. This momentum is reshaping product roadmaps, all due to different revolutions driven by edge AI. The Core Revolutions Driven by Edge AI Instead of routing every model and signal to the cloud, devices are processing more data locally to act faster and protect sensitive information. Because edge AI is changing where intelligence runs, IDC estimates global spending on edge computing reached about $261 billion in 2025. This rapid enterprise investment is due to several reasons. 1. Enabling Real-Time, On-Device Decisions Eliminating the cloud round-trip lets devices turn sensor input into action in milliseconds. This capability is essential for industrial automation and control loops because embedded AI processors run optimized models on-device, so decisions happen continuously. 2. Strengthening Privacy [...]</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi CM0 is a yet-to-be-officially-announced castellated Compute Module based on the Raspberry Pi RP3A0 SiP (System-in-Package) found in the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3E (CM3E). Since most Raspberry Pi products are announced under a strict embargo, I&#8217;m always surprised when I find new Raspberry Pi hardware that was never formally introduced. But it seems to happen from time to time for products targeting business customers specifically. The CM3E Compute Module was one example, and the CM0 appears to be another.

<p>Compex Systems (Compex) is redefining how wireless is integrated into modern embedded and industrial systems with the launch of JustWiFi⁷™, a one-of-a-kind, driverless, tri-band concurrent Wi-Fi 7 module that connects through Ethernet protocols. Designed to eliminate the complexity of traditional wireless integration, JustWiFi⁷™ makes high-performance Wi-Fi deployment faster, simpler, and smarter. Rethinking Wi-Fi Integration: No Drivers. No Hassle. JustWiFi⁷™ Most of the Wi-Fi modules today rely on PCIe, SDIO, or USB interfaces and are controlled through drivers. Developers will need to deal with the drivers&#8217; compatibility with the host platform, particularly its OS and kernel version. The drivers for Wi-Fi 7 are particularly complex due to the standard&#8217;s advanced features. Many open-sourced drivers and sometimes the host CPU are not able to deliver the full capabilities of the Wi-Fi 7 chipset. These complications often unnecessarily slow down and add to the development time and effort. Engineered for speed, simplicity, and [...]</p>

<p>GL.iNet Comet PoE (GL-RM1PE) is a new KVM over IP solution featuring a quad-core Correx-A53 SoC, support for Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), a 32GB eMMC flash, and the usual HDMI and USB ports. It&#8217;s essentially an upgrade to the Comet PoE (GL-RM1) KVM over IP box equipped with PoE and a 32GB eMMC flash capable of handling larger ISO files. It also relies on the faster Cortex-A53 processor used in the upcoming Comet Pro, currently on Kickstarter, with WiFi 6, a 2.2-inch touchscreen display, and HDMI passthrough. GL.iNet also claims faster file transfer (35 MB/s read &#38; 25 MB/s write speeds) of about three times faster than the original Comet. Comet PoE specifications: SoC – Unnamed quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU (Potentially Rockchip RV1126B) System Memory – 1GB DDR3L Storage – 32GB eMMC flash Video &#38; Audio Input – HDMI port up to 2K @ 60 FPS (2160 x 1440 @ 60 FPS); H.264 [...]</p>

<p>People have been recycling batteries in disposable vapes for a while, but BogdanTheGeek has gone a lot of further, converting a specific model of disposable vape into a web server. How is that possible? Vapes have apparently become a bit more sophisticated in recent times, and some integrate an Arm Cortex microcontroller with a USB-C port that can be used to bring a network interface and run a web server. The specific disposable vape (exact model not provided, but Grok thinks it may be from Bang King. Update: Wrong!) used by BogdanTheGeek features one of the ultra-cheap Puya PY32 microcontrollers, namely a 24 MHz PY32F002B Cortex-M0+ MCU with 3 kB SRAM and 24 kB flash. The web server hack here involves using the SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol) through a /dev/tty device to bring up a network interface, along with uIP lightweight TCP/IP stack. The first implementation was really slow [...]</p>

<p>After being on the platform since 2006 (though for me, not being a 'professional' YouTuber until about 5 years ago), I'm used to seasonal dips, adjustments after new tweaks to the algorithm or layout/design changes.</p>
