<p>This air quality monitor costs $250. It's called the <a href="https://networkedartifacts.com/airlab">Air Lab</a>, and I've been using it to measure the air in my car, home, studio, and a few events over the past few months. And in using it over the course of a road trip I learned to not run recirculate in my car quite as often—more on that later.</p>

<p>While the hot dog's flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"><em>Amplitude</em> Modulation</a>, where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down.

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p></div>
