The Cache Aware Scheduling development was led by Intel but helps other CPU vendors too for processors with multiple cache domains. Back in October I showed some nice performance wins for AMD EPYC Turin with Cache Aware Scheduling while today's article are some benchmarks of the newest CAS code and looking at the performance benefit on Xeon 6 "Granite Rapids" processors.]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 15:10:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Blender Working On KosmicKrisp Support For Vulkan On macOS</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Blender-KosmicKrisp-Vulkan-Mac</link><description><![CDATA[The Blender 3D modeling software could enjoy better macOS support with better cross-platform code paths thanks to in-development work for leveraging KosmicKrisp for Vulkan API usage on macOS via Metal...]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:26:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AMD ROCm 7.10 Released - Strix Point APUs Now Officially Supported</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-ROCm-7.10-Released</link><description><![CDATA[Sure enough, yesterday's inaugural TheRock 7.10 release tag ended up being a precursor to ROCm 7.10 as predicted in the earlier article.

<p>There are plenty of e-book readers on the market, but the Diptyx E-Reader feels more like a proper book since it features two e-paper displays that can be folded or opened thanks to a custom-made plastic enclosure. While it&#8217;s powered by an ESP32-S3 wireless module with a PCB antenna, both WiFi and Bluetooth are disabled in the firmware, and instead, users can load EPUB files through the reader&#8217;s USB Type-C port. The combination of an automatic standby mode (using deep sleep) and e-ink displays enables the dual-screen device to run for weeks on a single charge. Two buttons are used to access the next or previous page, and a third one powers the device up in a few seconds.

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>

<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>

<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to review three Intel-based UP AI development kits running Ubuntu 24.04 Pro. Last time, I tested the UP TWL SBC with Nx Meta and UP AI Toolkit, and most AI workloads would pass, but since these were running on the Intel N150 CPU or GPU, the performance was not optimal for most. I&#8217;ll now switch to the UP Squared Pro TWL &#8220;mid-range&#8221; AI devkit review with another Intel Processor N150 SBC fitted with a 13 TOPS Hailo-8L M.2 AI accelerator. Both the UP TWL and UP Squared Pro TWL come with a 64GB eMMC flash, and I found out it was rather tight since AI software and models can take a lot of space. The UP Squared Pro TWL has a few M.2 sockets, so I&#8217;ll install an NVMe SSD to expand storage before installing the UP AI toolkit. As usual, I’ll run a few benchmarks and [...]</p>

<p>After the release of the high-performance EPYC Embedded 9005, AMD has now introduced the EPYC Embedded 2005 Series, a mid-range processor family also based on the &#8220;Zen 5&#8221; architecture and designed for space-constrained networking, storage, and industrial edge applications. The new SoCs feature up to 16 cores (32 threads) with 64 MB L3 cache, support dual-channel DDR5-5600 memory with ECC, and offer 28 lanes of PCIe Gen5 connectivity. It also supports advanced RAS capabilities, BMC, PCIe Hot Plug, multi-SPI ROM, and AMD Infinity Guard security. The processors come in a compact 40 x 40mm BGA package, which, according to AMD, is up to 2.4x smaller than competing enterprise solutions (Intel Xeon 6500P-B). Yet, they are designed for 24/7 operation, with up to 10 years of availability with full open-source software support. These features make it suitable for networking switches/routers, cold storage systems, aerospace, robotics, and other high-reliability embedded infrastructure. EPYC [...]</p>

<p>The 52Pi UPS Gen 6 is another UPS solution for the Raspberry Pi 5 that supports external battery packs for long-duration projects, and uses I²C plus PikaPython scripting to manage power settings and safe shutdowns. Designed for the Raspberry Pi 5 and 4B, the module mounts on the bottom of the board and delivers power via pogo pins. It also includes an aluminum heatsink with an automatic fan for cooling. It runs on two 18650 batteries, which can be mounted to the Pi with spacers, and there is an option to add three more battery packs in parallel if you need longer runtime. The board also features a physical power button for manual control, a 12V power interface for SATA hard drives, and switching hardware (bumpless power transfer) that instantly falls back to battery power so the system stays on during a power outage. 52Pi UPS Gen 6 specifications: Main [...]</p>

<p>FlashESP is a web-based tool allowing the development of Arduino sketches and firmware flashing for ESP32 and ESP8266 hardware platforms. I initially thought it was similar to ESP Web Tools for flashing firmware from the web and used by projects like ESPHome, but it goes further than that, and it looks like an Arduino Cloud Editor for ESP32/ESP8266 instead, since users can select boards, write code, load libraries, and flash the resulting firmware from a compatible web browser without installing anything else on their computer. FlashESP key features: Cloud Compilation &#8211; Real-time compilation with live logs. Auto Configuration &#8211; Intelligent board and library detection. One-Click Flash &#8211; Web Serial integration. Connect your ESP via USB and flash directly from a compatible browser (WebSerial support needed) without any drivers or downloads.

<p>Nordic has introduced the nRF7002 EBII as an updated Wi-Fi 6 expansion board for its nRF54L series development kits. The earlier nRF7002 WiFi 6 board was a low-cost add-on for the Thingy:53, mainly for basic prototyping. The new EBII is designed for the newer nRF54L series of SoCs with dual-band Wi-Fi 6 support, power-profiling options, and more. Built around the nRF7002 Wi-Fi Companion IC, it supports Wi-Fi 6 features such as TWT, OFDMA, and BSS coloring for power efficiency and reduced interference. The EBII communicates with nRF54L15 and nRF54LM20 DKs through SPI/QSPI host interfaces, and includes headers for power profiling. Additionally, it features an onboard chip antenna, supports both STA and SoftAP modes, and maintains backward compatibility with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac.

<p>Anyone who has designed a custom ESP32 board or an RK3588 carrier knows the real bottleneck isn’t creativity — it’s the grunt work. Finding components that are actually in stock, checking pin compatibility, verifying footprints, building symbols, and dealing with yet another “NRND” surprise. It slows down even simple projects. A Multi-Agent System Built for Hardware Workflows YumiAI is a multi-agent engineering stack with the following features: Function Definition Agent: interprets requirements (“STM32WL LoRaWAN node, USB-C power”) and structures them into a proper engineering spec. Component Selection Agent: pulls real-time availability and pricing from DigiKey, Mouser, and LCSC. PCB Schematic Agent: generate circuit schematics using factory rules from a decade of manufacturing data to avoid unbuildable designs. The Killer Feature Today: Idea Validation While the schematic/PCB engine is still in active testing — and complex designs will require manual review — the market and business layers are already production-ready.

<p>When 3D printing, users will always waste filament one way or the other, either due to a failed print or because of the support for the print, and there may also be test/old prints that you don&#8217;t need/use anymore, for example, a retraction cube or a benchy. That means all that material usually ends up in the dustbin. Priyank Pal, founder of Creative3dp, did not like all that waste, so he created the ExtrudeX machine to recycle 3D print waste and filament scraps back into usable filament. On top of that, the machine itself is 3D printable and much more affordable than commercial solutions from companies such as Filabot. I&#8217;d usually provide the specifications here, but as a crowdfunded project, the ExtrudeX&#8217;s full technical details are not fully available.

<p>Silicognition ManT1S is an ESP32 board with a 4-pole terminal block for T1S single-pair Ethernet (SPE) communication and daisy-chaining, as well as unpopulated headers for GPIOs and programming, and a Qwicc connector for I2C expansion. The IEEE 802.3cg 10BASE-T1S networking standard enables engineers and users to easily network and distribute power to up to eight T1S nodes over a single pair of wires, which makes it suitable for robotics, industrial/home automation, and other projects that benefit from a reduction in the number of cables and associated weight. The company also designed the ManT1S Bridge to interface a standard Ethernet RJ45 to a single-pair T1S mixing segment. ManT1S specifications: System-in-Package &#8211; ESP32-PICO-V3-O2 SoC &#8211; ESP32 CPU &#8211; Xtensa dual-core 32-bit LX6 microprocessor up to 240 MHz Memory &#8211; 520B SRAM Storage &#8211; 448 KB ROM Wireless &#8211; WiFi 4 and Bluetooth 4.2/5.x Memory &#8211; 2 MB PSRAM Storage &#8211; 8 MB [...]</p>

<p>One interesting addition to the just-released Linux 6.18 kernel is the Tyr Rust GPU driver for CSF-based Arm Mali GPUs, which is a port of the mature Panthor C GPU driver merged into Linux 6.10. It was developed by Collabora in collaboration with Arm and Google. Tyr aims to implement the same userspace API offered by Panthor, so that it can eventually be used as a drop-in replacement in the company&#8217;s PanVK Vulkan driver. After several years, the Tyr Rust driver might replace the Panthor C driver, but in the meantime, Panthor will keep being used since it is more mature and conformant with OpenGL ES 3.1 since July 2024. The work on Tyr is fairly advanced, and Collabora provided an update at the end of November. The key takeaway is that the Tyr (prototype) driver works with  GNOME, Weston, and even full-screen 3D games like SuperTuxKart while matching the [...]</p>

<p>We finally have Intel Arc GPUs working on the Pi <em>somewhat</em> stably—it required overcoming many small hurdles, but it looks like support could land in Raspberry Pi OS if we can get <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250715061837.2144388-1-zhangzhijie@bosc.ac.cn/">a simple patch upstreamed</a><sup id="patchnote"><a href="#fn:patchnote" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. If that happens, all you'd need to do to use an Intel card on a Pi is install a firmware package.</p>
