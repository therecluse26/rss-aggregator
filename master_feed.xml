<p>The Waveshare ESP32-S3-Knob-Touch-LCD-1.8 is a batterry-powered knob display board designed for HMI applications that combines ESP32-S3 and ESP32 SoCs in a dual MCU architecture. The design differs from other ESP32-based knob / rotary encoder with a built-in display such as the MaTouch SmartKnob, M5Dial, and LILYGO T-Encoder Pro. The Waveshare device also stands out with a larger 1.8-inch capacitive touch display, integrated audio DAC, and real-time audio visualization. It comes with a CNC-milled full-metal enclosure for a more premium and durable build. The devkit supports swipe gestures and volume control, and can be used as a Pomodoro timer, a text reader, a secondary PC screen, and a Bluetooth audio player through a 3.5mm audio jack. Other features include a digital microphone, a vibration motor, and a microSD card slot for storage.

<p>The ESPHome 2025.6.0 open-source firmware was released on June 18, 2025, with ESP32-P4 support and an initial OpenThread implementation for ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 SoCs, thanks to an upgrade to the ESP-IDF framework to version 5.3.2. The developers note that support for ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, and ESP32-P4 is still being refined, and some components may not yet be fully compatible with these chips, but additional component updates are planned for ESPHome 2025.7.0 next month. That still means that ESPHome devices can connect to Thread networks and communicate with Home Assistant through the Native API as long as you have an OpenThread border router and Thread is enabled in Home Assistant. Users should note some limitations to Thread support: ESPHome does not yet support the Thread “Sleepy End Device” mode Not recommended for applications requiring high-frequency sensor data transmission Best suited for simple control and monitoring use cases Other changes to ESPHome 2025.6.0 [...]</p>

<p>Back in 2022, we first saw STMicro launch the VL53L5CP ToF presence detection sensor for the PC market with features like user detection, gesture recognition, and intruder alert. Building upon that, the company has recently released its 5th‑generation Human Presence Detection (HPD) solution, built around the VL53L8CP 8×8 multizone Time‑of‑Flight sensor family with edge AI features offered as a turnkey solution for laptops, PCs, monitors, and accessories. We have seen and even tested earlier ToF sensors like the VL53L0X and VL53L1X, which used a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) for single-zone ranging. After that, we saw ST release the VL53L5, which was a major upgrade with up to 64-zone multi-zone support, enabling features like touch-to-focus and object tracking. Now, in the age of AI, ST has launched a 5th-gen turnkey HPD solution built around the VL53L8CP sensor.

I initially thought I would skip that one since it&#8217;s not super relevant to the usual topics covered on CNX Software, but seeing bolts on the photos, I figured out it might still be interesting to do a teardown of the skateboard to see how it works. So here I am. I&#8217;ll also go through an unboxing first, and check its features and performance. MEEPO V5 unboxing The package was quite larger and longer than I expected. That&#8217;s partially because there were two packages: one for the electric skateboard itself, and the other for a helmet. The skateboard is also quite bigger and heavier (8kg)  than the skateboards I tried to use when I was a child. The build quality looks excellent. There are some marks and dust on the wheels and deck because I tried it before taking [...]</p>

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest post by Ohad Peled, Product Marketing Manager at Sony Semiconductor Israel, about the challenges of tracking a large number of IoT assets and how LTE-M can help businesses scale tracking solutions. Over the last few years, asset tracking has emerged as a critical business function and is estimated to grow to a $34.5B market by 2032, according to Custom Market Insights. Whether businesses are monitoring a global supply chain or keeping tabs on expensive equipment, knowing where assets are at all times is essential. It enables businesses to optimize supply chains, prevent theft, and reduce operational downtime. There are several technical and commercial challenges in deploying such a solution, which could result in failure to deliver the promised value. Some solutions struggle to maintain accurate tracking as assets move within or across different facilities, especially if they go through an indoor environment. Others suffer from [...]</p>

<p>Pinefeat has designed an EF/EF-S lens controller and adapter for the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, compatible with Canon lenses, and implementing full electronic control of autofocus and aperture. Canon EF (Electro-Focus) and EF-S (Electro-Focus Short Back Focus) lenses are designed for the company&#8217;s DSLR cameras with an EOS (electronic autofocus system). They have great optics, built-in motors taking care of focusing, and also handle aperture electronically. Pinefeat is a fan of the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, but it requires manual focus and aperture adjustment, and that&#8217;s why he created a controller and adapter compatible with Canon EF/EF-S lenses. The kit is comprised of the following components: Canon EF / EF-S lens to C-mount camera adapter with a plastic housing and some metal components (66 x 26.5mm) Lens control board Camera I/F &#8211; 15-pin MIPI CSI-2 FFC/FPC connector Camera mount &#8211; C-mount Lens mount &#8211; Canon EF or EF-S Host interface [...]</p>

We first came across this low-cost MCU back in March this year, and saw that the official development board became available for purchase as early as April. The nanoCH57x development board currently features the 100 MHz  CH572D RISC-V microcontroller (the CH570D version is coming later), which includes 256KB of flash memory, 12KB of SRAM, and an onboard 32 MHz crystal. The board also includes a USB 2.0 Type-C Host/Device port and PCB antenna for BLE/RF communication.

<p>The AgroSense AGLW2CT is a dual-channel LoRaWAN-based industrial AC energy meter that utilizes 10A and 100A CT clamps to measure power consumption non-invasively. The device features two 0–5V analog inputs for the clamps, an AHT20 temperature &#38; humidity sensor, and local storage for 3,300+ records. It supports LoRaWAN 1.0.3 OTAA Class C and works with TTN, Datacake, and CloudStudio. The device operates within the -40°C to 85°C industrial temperature range and is suitable for contactless current sensing, overload/no-load detection, and machine health monitoring. We had previously covered, and even reviewed, several Wi-Fi-connected CT clamps meters such as the MachineQ&#8217;s MQpower CT, Seeed Studio&#8217;s XIAO-2CH-EM, and Emporia&#8217;s Vue Gen 2 energy monitor, but it&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve come across a LoRa AC energy meter with CT clamps.

<p>The NFC Forum has just announced NFC Release 15 that quadruples NFC range from 0.5cm to 2cm and enables faster, more reliable contactless interactions for wireless charging, kitchen appliances, wearables, and digital keys. The extended NFC range, also known as the operating volume, may make some people laugh since it&#8217;s only 2 cm we are talking about, but it has practical applications, as NFC contactless interactions will start sooner and require less precise device alignment. The NFC Release 15 also focuses on the NFC Digital Product Passport Standard to provide a data-agnostic framework allowing a single NFC tag to store and transmit both standard and extended DPP data using common NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) records. I wish I could explain how the extended NFC range and DPP standard are implemented in the new release, but I can&#8217;t because the technical specifications are only available for download to NFC Forum [...]</p>

<p>The ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 is a development board based on the ESP32-C61 low-cost WiFi 6 and Bluetooth LE 5.0 SoC that was first unveiled in January 2024, and has just entered mass production this month (June 2025). The board is offered with two USB-C ports, two buttons, an RGB LED, and GPIO headers. In my 2024 year in review report, I noted that Espressif would likely launch the ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 SoC in 2025, but I completely forgot about the ESP32-C61, which is basically a cost-down version of the ESP32-C6.

<p>Most ESP32-P4 boards and development platforms we&#8217;ve covered so far include an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-C5 wireless module, and in case you don&#8217;t want any WiFi and Bluetooth module, the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit is one option that comes with Ethernet instead. The ALIENTEK DNESP32P4M board, also called ESP32P4M MINI, adds another option with a form factor similar to Espressif Systems Devkit-C boards. The board does not have network connectivity at all, and exposes all I/Os from the ESP32-P4 through headers, MIPI DSI and MIPI CSI connectors, and two USB-C ports.
