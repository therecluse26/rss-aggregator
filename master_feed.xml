<p>Bigme HiBreak Pro Color is an Android 14 smartphone with 4G LTE and 5G cellular connectivity, and a more unique feature: a 6.13-inch E-Ink color display. We had seen a few smartphones with E-ink grayscale displays in the past, with products such as the Hisense A5 or YotaPhone 3, but phones with an E-Ink color display are more of a rarity, and the Bigme HiBreak Pro Color adds to the Hisense A7CC. Other key features include a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 octa-core Cortex-A78/A55 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB UFS flash. Bigme HiBreak Pro Color specifications: SoC &#8211; MediaTek Dimensity 1080 Octa-core CPU &#8211; 4x Arm Cortex-A78 cores @ 2.6 GHz, 4x Arm Cortex-A55 cores @ 2.0 GHz GPU &#8211; Arm Mali-G68 MC4 VPU Video decoding &#8211; H.265, H.264, MPEG-4, VP9 up to 4K @ 30 FPS Video encoding &#8211; H.265, H.264 up to 4K @ 30 FPS System Memory [...]</p>

<p>RAKwireless &#8220;RAK3112 WisDuo Module for Edge AI with LoRa&#8221; combines an ESP32-S3 WiFi and BLE SoC with a Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver for Edge AI applications and Meshtastic user interfaces. The 3-in-1 LoRa + WiFi  + BLE module is an update to the ESP32-based RAK11200 WisDuo LoRa module, which has limitations in terms of computing power and memory. Those became apparent in more demanding applications such as Edge AI or complex mesh networks. With 16MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM and a more powerful ESP32-S3 microcontroller, the RAK3112 WisDuo module overcomes those limitations for camera and audio processing, as well as mesh networks like Meshtastic. It also offers a more powerful alternative to the pin-compatible RAK11160 STM32 + ESP32-C2 module that&#8217;s better suited for battery-powered sensors.

<p>SeeedStudio sent us a tiny Smart IR Remote hub for review: XIAO Smart IR Mate, or XIAO IR Mate for short. At first glance, it looks like any other WiFi IR blasters, but what makes it interesting is that the device is built on an open architecture using the XIAO ESP32C3 module and runs on ESPHome, working natively with the Home Assistant open-source home automation platform. As usual, SeeedStudio gives access to the source code, so it’s super convenient if you want to tweak the functions yourself to fit various needs. For those who are new to Smart IR, it&#8217;s a device that acts as an infrared (IR) control hub. The idea is to let you control legacy IR-based devices (old TVs, air conditioners, stereos, etc.) via a Smart Home system. We did several tests with several devices we had lying around, namely a Hatari oscillating fan, a Dyson blade-less [...]</p>

<p>We often write about breadboard-friendly boards, which typically means they plug nicely into a breadboard, but usually leave only one or two rows to play with on each side. So far, the best option we have come across is probably the Raspberry Breadstick, which is designed for full-length breadboards, but is limited by the I/Os on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU. When it comes to breadboard friendliness, it&#8217;s hard to beat The Pi Hut&#8217;s Baguette S3, as it provides a single 30-pin header designed to be inserted in one of the rows of a breadboard, leaving plenty of space for prototyping. The board also features an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, a microSD card slot, a USB-C for power and programming, a Qwiic port for further expansion, an RGB LED, and RESET and BOOT buttons.

<p>After being on the platform since 2006 (though for me, not being a 'professional' YouTuber until about 5 years ago), I'm used to seasonal dips, adjustments after new tweaks to the algorithm or layout/design changes.</p>

<p>But this was <em>substantial</em>.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve already checked out the hardware of the Beelink EQi13 Pro in the first part of the review, and followed up with a detailed review of the Intel Core i5-13500H mini PC running Windows 11 Pro. We&#8217;ve now taken the time to test the Beelink EQi13 Pro with Ubuntu 24.04 to find out how well (or not) it performs on Linux. We will specifically report our experience testing features, running benchmarks, checking out the SSD and USB ports, evaluating Gigabit Ethernet and WiFi 6 networking performance, and finally stress testing the mini PC, before measuring the fan noise and power consumption of the mini PC under Linux. Ubuntu 24.04 installation Since the plan is to install Ubuntu 24.04 LTS alongside Windows 11 in a dual-boot configuration, we shrank the Windows 11 partition to about half its size before inserting a USB drive prepared with the Ubuntu 24.04 ISO to start [...]</p>

<p>Realtek introduced the RTL8127 10GbE to PCIe NIC at Computex 2025 last May as a low-power, low-cost 10Gbps Ethernet solution for PCIe and M.2 networking cards with an estimated price of around $30 to $40. The good news is that 10GbE PCIe and M.2 cards are now available for sale, just not always at the expected price points. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the options available.

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>

<p>Libre Computer has just announced the general availability of EtherealOS for the company&#8217;s Amlogic SBCs, namely AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato), AML-S805X-AC (La Frite), AML-S905X-CC-V2 ( Sweet Potato), AML-S905D3-CC (Solitude), and AML-A311D-CC (Alta). EtherealOS is described as a lightweight internet-booted operating system designed for performing tasks such as file and disk manipulation, operating system deployment, light browser tasks, and more. It includes a limited set of tools compared to a full operating system, and it&#8217;s basically an OS to install other operating systems directly from the Internet, in a way similar to Khadas OOWOW or Radxa ROOBI OS. The difference is that EtherealOS apparently supports upstreamed operating systems, namely Debian (debian-12.11.0-arm64-DVD-1.iso / debian-testing-arm64-DVD-1.iso), Fedora (Fedora-Workstation-Live-42-1.1.aarch64.iso), and OpenSUSE, besides images optimized by Libre Computer based on Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspbian.

<p>TerraMaster has sent me the D1 SSD Plus portable SSD enclosure for review, and helped me get a 2TB WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD for testing, since the PCIe Gen4 x4 storage device reached up 7,300 MB/s to sequential read speeds, and 6,600 MB/s sequential write speeds, well beyond the 40Gbps capabilities of the enclosure. I had reviewed two ORICO NVMe enclosures previously, namely the ORICO COM2-T3 and ORICO M234C3-U4, which were both based on an Intel JH7440 Thunderbolt 3 chip. I tested the COM2-T3 up to 3166.71 MB/s with a fast SSD, but TerraMaster claims up to 3,853MB/s sequential read speed and 3,707 MB/s sequential write speed with a 4TB Samsung 990 PRO SSD, while connected to an Apple M4 Pro Mac mini (MacOS version 15.3.2) using AJA System Test software. So I thought it might be a good idea to give it a try. TerraMaster D1 SSD Plus unboxing [...]</p>

<p>LWMalloc is an ultra-lightweight dynamic memory allocator designed for embedded systems that is said to outperform ptmalloc used in Glibc, achieving up to 53% faster execution time and 23% lower memory usage. Malloc can cause memory fragmentation on embedded systems, potentially leading to crashes after the firmware runs long enough. Garbage collection is one technique for lowering fragmentation, but it&#8217;s not always practical on resource-constrained devices, and some simply avoid using malloc in their firmware, preferring static memory allocation or memory pools to improve reliability. Custom dynamic memory allocators are another option, and that&#8217;s what LWMalloc provides. LWMalloc is described in a paper entitled &#8220;LWMalloc: A Lightweight Dynamic Memory Allocator for Resource-Constrained Environments&#8221; as follows: LWMalloc incorporates a lightweight data structure, a deferred coalescing (DC) policy, and dedicated small chunk pools to optimize memory allocation. The lightweight data structure minimizes metadata overhead, ensuring a compact and efficient implementation. The DC [...]</p>

<p>ACMER X1 Ultra is a DIY maker&#8217;s dream, featuring a large 3-in-1 120W diode, 4W IR laser engraver, and CNC router with a large work area of around 2.5 x 1.2 meters, catering to the needs of most users. However, the company is fully aware that different users have different needs, so they create different versions of the machine: the X1 with a work area of 76.7 x 76.7 cm and no CNC support, the X1 Plus with a work area of about 1.2 x 1.2 meters, and the aforementioned X1 Ultra. You&#8217;ll find the key specifications for all three variants of the ACMER X1 machine in the table below. The 120W diode in the professional-grade laser system supports speeds of up to 3,0000mm/min. It&#8217;s 3-4 times faster and can cut workpieces twice as thick compared to a traditional 40W laser engraver, and delivers 6 times higher energy efficiency compared to [...]</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<p>You see, I was on a Reverse Engineering panel at Open Sauce, but <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1945207387914178562">I mentioned on Twitter</a>, I wouldn't call myself a reverse engineer, more like a 'guy who breaks things sometimes taking them apart, and learns many ways to not break things, sometimes.'</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>
