<p>We have already checked out the hardware of the GEEKOM Mini IT12 2025 Edition mini PC with an unboxing and a teardown in the first part of the review. The new model still relies on a 12th Intel processor, and simply replaced the 10-core Intel Core i7-12650H by a more powerful 14-core Intel Core i7-1280P processor still coupled with 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB M.2 SSD, although the brands and models of the RAM, storage, and wireless modules have changed. In the second part of the review, we will be testing the GEEKOM Mini IT12 2025 Edition mini PC with the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro in detail, notably testing most features and running benchmarks before comparing it to the (2023 Edition) Mini IT12 mini PC with an Intel Core i7-12650H processor.

<p>SunFounder has sent me a review sample of the Pironman 5 Max Tower PC case for the Raspberry Pi 5 SBC. We had already reviewed the Pironman 5 last year, but the new Max model has various improvements, including a sleeker design made of black aluminum and semi-transparent black acrylic panels, a dual NVMe PiP expansion board for two M.2 NVMe SSDs (optionally in RAID 0/1 configuration), or one NVMe SSD and one AI accelerator module, a Tap-to-Wake feature for the OLED information display, and programmable RGB LEDs for the two fans. So the Pironman 5 Max deserves another review of its own.  I&#8217;ll be doing an unboxing, going through the assembly instructions and software installation, before testing the new features, and finally, the cooling efficiency of the solution. Pironman 5 Max unboxing I received the Pironman 5 Max in its retail package along with a Raspberry Pi AI Kit [...]</p>

<p>AnyShake Explorer is a relatively affordable, open-source hardware seismic monitoring system that offers an alternative to the Raspberry Shake earthquake monitoring solutions. The device supports up to three 3-axis geophones and integrates a 3-axis accelerometer and a 32-bit ADC for measurements. You just need to connect it to a host like a laptop or an SBC such as a Raspberry Pi, an Orange Pi, a Radxa ROCK, or a NanoPi over a USB to RS232 cable to get started.

            <p>I've had a Pi and SDR earmarked for 'getting weather data from my weather station' for a long time now. I don't know why I waited so long, because it was shockingly easy.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p>

<p>The WisGate Connect for MIOTY is an industrial-grade hybrid IoT gateway with support for both MIOTY and LoRaWAN protocols. Built around the RAK7391 carrier board for Raspberry Pi CM4, it is designed for long-range IoT applications, including intelligent street lighting, waste management, environmental monitoring, and traffic flow control. In addition to dual-protocol (MIOTY and LoRaWAN) support, it features USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and a USB-C port for flashing, an HDMI output, and a UART header for debugging. Backhaul options include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or an optional 4G LTE module. The gateway can be powered in two ways: a wide input voltage DC jack or terminal block, or optional PoE+. We first wrote about the MIOTY Standard back in April 2020. After that, in September 2021, we saw Silicon Labs introduce EFR32FG23 (FG23) and EFR32ZG23 (ZG23) SoCs with MIOTY support, but it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve covered products built around this standard.

            <p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p>

            <p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>


.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }


<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p>

<p>The ESPHome 2025.6.0 open-source firmware was released on June 18, 2025, with ESP32-P4 support and an initial OpenThread implementation for ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 SoCs, thanks to an upgrade to the ESP-IDF framework to version 5.3.2. The developers note that support for ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, and ESP32-P4 is still being refined, and some components may not yet be fully compatible with these chips, but additional component updates are planned for ESPHome 2025.7.0 next month. That still means that ESPHome devices can connect to Thread networks and communicate with Home Assistant through the Native API as long as you have an OpenThread border router and Thread is enabled in Home Assistant. Users should note some limitations to Thread support: ESPHome does not yet support the Thread “Sleepy End Device” mode Not recommended for applications requiring high-frequency sensor data transmission Best suited for simple control and monitoring use cases Other changes to ESPHome 2025.6.0 [...]</p>

<p>Back in 2022, we first saw STMicro launch the VL53L5CP ToF presence detection sensor for the PC market with features like user detection, gesture recognition, and intruder alert. Building upon that, the company has recently released its 5th‑generation Human Presence Detection (HPD) solution, built around the VL53L8CP 8×8 multizone Time‑of‑Flight sensor family with edge AI features offered as a turnkey solution for laptops, PCs, monitors, and accessories. We have seen and even tested earlier ToF sensors like the VL53L0X and VL53L1X, which used a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) for single-zone ranging. After that, we saw ST release the VL53L5, which was a major upgrade with up to 64-zone multi-zone support, enabling features like touch-to-focus and object tracking. Now, in the age of AI, ST has launched a 5th-gen turnkey HPD solution built around the VL53L8CP sensor.

<p>I&#8217;ve just received an electric skateboard for review: the MEEPO V5. I initially thought I would skip that one since it&#8217;s not super relevant to the usual topics covered on CNX Software, but seeing bolts on the photos, I figured out it might still be interesting to do a teardown of the skateboard to see how it works. So here I am. I&#8217;ll also go through an unboxing first, and check its features and performance. MEEPO V5 unboxing The package was quite larger and longer than I expected. That&#8217;s partially because there were two packages: one for the electric skateboard itself, and the other for a helmet. The skateboard is also quite bigger and heavier (8kg)  than the skateboards I tried to use when I was a child. The build quality looks excellent. There are some marks and dust on the wheels and deck because I tried it before taking [...]</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's quite simple, really: using my <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/">Home Assistant Yellow</a>'s built-in Zigbee radio, I connect a number of <a href="https://amzn.to/45oROls">ThirdReality Zigbee Smart Outlets</a> to it, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card">ApexCharts Cards</a> to add graphs of power consumption over time on my Home Assistant dashboards.</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p>
