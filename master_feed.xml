For the past ten years Intel software engineers have been crafting Clear Linux as a high performance distribution that is extensively optimized for x86_64 processors via aggressive compiler tuning, various patches to the Linux kernel and other packages, and a variety of other optimizations throughout the operating system. For years Clear Linux has led Linux x86_64 performance not only on Intel desktop/mobile/server hardware but on AMD systems too. Here is a final look at the Clear Linux performance on the Intel side compared to the performance of the latest Ubuntu 25.04 release.]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Micron Claims Industry&amp;#8217;s Highest Density SLC NAND for Space</title><link>https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/micron-claims-industrys-highest-density-single-layer-cell-nand-for-space/</link><description><![CDATA[Micron’s 256-Gb radiation-tolerant SLC NAND meets tight aerospace reliability benchmarks.]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Intel Quietly Sunset Its PlaidML Open-Source Deep Learning Software</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-PlaidML-Archived</link><description><![CDATA[Another hit to the open-source Intel software ecosystem this year was the company formally archiving/discontinuing work on the PlaidML deep learning software.

<p>Bosch Sensortech BME690 8x shuttle board is a sensor board comprised of eight identical BM690 4-in-1 gas/temperature/humidity/pressure sensors capable of monitoring indoor air quality and detecting Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSCs), and other gases. The obvious question is &#8220;What&#8217;s going on? Why would a board need 8 identical sensors?&#8221;.

It&#8217;s closer to the UNO R4 Minima in terms of functionality, since it lacks the ESP32 wireless module and LED matrix found in the UNO R4 WiFi board. The new Nano R4 still features a USB-C port, an I2C Qwiic connector, and two 15-pin GPIO headers with castellated holes for expansion.

It ships with a Bluetooth remote that supports Google Assistant voice commands. The company did not list the exact part number of the processor, and while it matches the Amlogic S905X5M specifications, it should be another model without Ethernet support, like Amlogic did in the past with the S905Y4, so maybe an S905Y5M?

A big feat he's been tackling is enabling support for analog display connectors within the AMDGPU driver for the "DC" code. Besides a few supported older GPUs having DVI-I connections, this analog support is significant in that it's a milestone for unblocking the aging GCN 1.0 and GCN 1.1 GPUs from using the modern AMDGPU driver by default...]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 00:32:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Avalue VNS-10WAD – A 10.1-inch slim, fanless Intel N50 touch panel PC with antibacterial housing</title><link>https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/07/24/avalue-vns-10wad-a-10-1-inch-slim-fanless-intel-n50-touch-panel-pc-with-antibacterial-housing/</link><description><![CDATA[<div><img width="720" height="480" src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VNS-10WAD-10.1-Inch-Ultra-Slim-Panel-PC-angle-view-720x480.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="VNS 10WAD 10.1 Inch Ultra Slim Panel PC angle view" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VNS-10WAD-10.1-Inch-Ultra-Slim-Panel-PC-angle-view-720x480.jpg 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VNS-10WAD-10.1-Inch-Ultra-Slim-Panel-PC-angle-view-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VNS-10WAD-10.1-Inch-Ultra-Slim-Panel-PC-angle-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VNS-10WAD-10.1-Inch-Ultra-Slim-Panel-PC-angle-view.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" /></div>

<p>We&#8217;ve been sent the OMBAR DC42 Dash Cam for review. It&#8217;s a car dash cam kit with a 4K UHD front camera and a 1080p FHD rear camera, each with a wide F1.8 aperture that allows more light for clear images day and night. The kit ships with a 64GB microSD card and supports cards with up to 256GB capacity. The distraction-free, screenless camera supports dual-band (2.4 + 5GHz) WiFi connectivity, GPS location recording to show driving routes, voice guidance, and in-car audio recording. The dash cam also includes accident detection with a G-sensor and a 24-hour parking mode, but the latter requires the optional OMBAR 3-lead hard-wire kit, which sadly was not included in our kit. In this review, we will start with the specifications of the OMBAR 42 dash car, go through an unboxing, report our experience installing the cameras in our car (spoiler: it&#8217;s much easier than [...]</p>

<p>While Meshtastic is by far the most popular off-grid messaging solution relying on LoRa radios, MeshCore offers an alternative as a lightweight C++ library and firmware designed for multi-hop packet routing and made for developers who want to create resilient, decentralized communication networks that work without the internet. The project&#8217;s GitHub repository provides some high-level differences compared to the Meshtastic and Reticulum projects: MeshCore provides the ability to create wireless mesh networks, similar to Meshtastic and Reticulum but with a focus on lightweight multi-hop packet routing for embedded projects. Unlike Meshtastic, which is tailored for casual LoRa communication, or Reticulum, which offers advanced networking, MeshCore balances simplicity with scalability, making it ideal for custom embedded solutions., where devices (nodes) can communicate over long distances by relaying messages through intermediate nodes. This is especially useful in off-grid, emergency, or tactical situations where traditional communication infrastructure is unavailable. MeshCore key features: Multi-hop [...]</p>

<p>The last original Commodore 64 keyboard computer was sold in 1994, and since then, the Commodore brand and assets have been owned by various companies over the years, until YouTuber Christian Simpson (Perifractic) bought all assets earlier this year to revive the brand and launch the Commodore 64 Ultimate. The Commodore 64 Ultimate is based on an AMD Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA coupled with 128MB RAM and 16MB NOR flash, and can emulate the original computer, giving access to over 10,000 games and programs made for the original C64 computer. The new computer is a mix of old interfaces with analog outputs for CRT TVs, cartridges, SID sockets, and disk drives, and more recent ones, such as HDMI, WiFi, USB, and more. Commodore 64 Ultimate specifications: FPGA &#8211; AMD Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA System Memory &#8211; 128MB DDR2 RAM Storage 16MB NOR flash Internal microSD card slot Support for USB flash drives [...]</p>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p></div>
