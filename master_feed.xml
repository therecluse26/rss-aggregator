<p>Raspberry Pi OS Trixie now supports USB gadget mode out of the box, allowing users to connect to their Raspberry Pi boards over IP through USB without the need for a router. My first experience with USB gadget functionality was when I reviewed the Beaglebone Green Wireless SBC in 2016, but for some reason, official support for the Raspberry Pi ecosystem took a lot longer, and it was only officially implemented in Raspberry Pi OS Trixie images dated 20.10.2025 and later through the rpi-usb-gadget package. It&#8217;s been possible to use the USB gadget mode on Raspberry Pi OS for a while, but it was rather convoluted with outdated scripts, manual configuration steps, and platform-specific instructions. The new rpi-usb-gadget package streamlines the process and makes things much easier: The Raspberry Pi SBC will present itself as a USB Ethernet device when connected to a PC Users can SSH directly using the [...]</p>

<p>Last year, Geehy introduced the industry’s first dual-core Cortex-M52 real-time MCU, and has now followed up with the G32R430, an Arm Cortex-M52 Encoder MCU with two 16-bit ADCs and a hardware ATAN (arctangent) accelerator for sub-1 µs electrical angle computation in high-precision encoder and motion control systems. The MCU is clocked at 128 MHz and uses ITCM/DTCM tightly coupled memory for deterministic, zero-wait-state execution, alongside a 4KB cache for low-latency control loops. It integrates two 16-bit high-precision ADCs with support for synchronous sampling, along with an extra 12-bit ADC, multiple analog comparators, DACs, and an on-chip temperature sensor, allowing encoder designs to be built with very few external analog components. It also supports various encoder protocols, including BiSS-C, SSI, Tamagawa, and SPI, and includes generic interfaces like USART, SPI, and I²C. With a –40°C to +105°C industrial operating range, this MCU is suitable for servo motors, industrial robots, absolute and incremental [...]</p>

<p>ESPHome 2026.1.0 open-source firmware has just been released with new features like automatic WiFi roaming and Zigbee support for Nordic Semi nRF52 targets, as well as memory optimization for ESP32/ESP8266 hardware, among many other changes. Other notable changes include security updates with the project replacing API password authentication with API encryption and requiring SHA256 authentication for OTA updates, better support for non-ASCII configuration, and updates to LibreTiny platforms (BK72xx, RTL87xx, LN882x), which received thread-safe WiFi, atomics, and deep sleep support. ESPHome developers used to advise users not to use ESP8266, not because it was not suitable for the task, but because the runtime heap on ESP8266 routinely dropped below 10k, and devices were unreliable. Since millions of ESP8266 devices were already deployed in homes, they decided to do something about it.

<p>We have received a sample of the SONOFF Dongle Plus MG24 (also known as Dongle-PMG24) Zigbee/Thread USB dongle for review. As its name implies, it&#8217;s based on a Silicon Labs EFR32MG24 wireless chip, and the company claims up to 200 meters range thanks to an included 3dBi antenna. It is compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi OS, and other operating systems that support USB serial drivers. The dongle works seamlessly with popular open-source platforms, such as Home Assistant, Zigbee2MQTT, ioBroker, and OpenHAB. In this review, we will go through an unboxing of the SONOFF Dongle Plus MG24, before connecting it to a Raspberry Pi 4 running Home Assistant. We will use two Zigbee devices from SONOFF: the  AirGuard TH (SNZB-02DR2) temperature and humidity sensor with an LCD, and the MINI DUO-L (MINI-ZB2GS-L) dual-channel/2-gang Zigbee 3.0 switch to demonstrate how to use the dongle with Home Assistant.

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since FriendlyELEC has released a board, and the NanoPC-T6 Plus SBC is more of a variant of the NanoPC-T6 and NanoPC-T6 LTS rather than a really new board. It&#8217;s still based on a Rockchip RK3588 octa-core SoC, and equipped with two HDMI 2.1 ports, an HDMI input port, MIPI DSI/CSI interfaces, two 2.5GbE ports, and M.2 sockets for NVMe SSD and wireless, among other features. The main change appears to be that the new model is now offered with up to 32GB LPDDR5 rather than up to 16GB LPDDR4x in the previous models. It&#8217;s closer to the NanoPC-T6 LTS, although it now supports two analog microphones instead of just one, and restores the M.2 Key-B socket for optional 4G LTE connectivity found in the original NanoPC-T6. The 10-pin UART + 2x USB 2.0 header found in the LTS variant gives way to a 3-pin UART debug [...]</p>

<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital transformation, a technical plateau has emerged. While many &#8220;AI-coding&#8221; tools offer the promise of rapid development, a predictable pattern has surfaced: they generate visually impressive landing pages in seconds, but falter when tasked with building a functional business. Projects requiring user authentication, data persistence, or secure transaction handling often hit a technical ceiling, resulting in digital &#8220;toys&#8221; rather than scalable business tools. The release of YouBase by YouWare marks a significant shift in this narrative. Since its debut in March 2025, YouWare has pioneered the concept of &#8220;vibe coding,&#8221; capturing 500,000 monthly active users and a $200 million valuation. With the introduction of YouBase, the platform transitions from a prototyping environment to a production-ready engine, offering a missing link for enterprises looking to leverage AI for full-stack development.

<p>All SONOFF WiFi and Zigbee home automation devices can now work with the Matter protocol. This can be done in two ways: Software path (free of charge)  &#8211; Use eWelink CUBE OS on a Raspberry Pi or other host computer to bridge SONOFF WiFi &#38; Zigbee devices to Matter. Hardware path — Install a certified Matter gateway such as SONOFF iHost, ZBBridge-U, or NSPanel Pro, and pair your WiFi/Zigbee devices to use them with Matter. The main benefit is that you no longer need to use the eWelink app, and any SONOFF devices can now work with Matter-compatible platforms, such as Apple Home, Google Home, SmartThings, Amazon Alexa, and Home Assistant. I&#8217;ll focus on the software solution in this post. Most users will likely install eWelink CUBE OS on a Raspberry Pi 4/5 connected to a supported USB Zigbee dongle if they have Zigbee devices.

<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>
<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>
<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>
<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>
</ul>

<p>Ever since I got <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/using-amd-gpus-on-raspberry-pi-without-recompiling-linux">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/all-intel-gpus-run-on-raspberry-pi-and-risc-v">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia</a> graphics cards to run on a Raspberry Pi, I had a nagging question:</p>
<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s. Not a fair fight.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:04:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Last week in AWS re:Invent with Corey Quinn</title><link>https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/19/last-week-in-aws-re-invent-with-corey-quinn/</link><description><![CDATA[Ryan sits down with Corey Quinn, Chief Cloud Economist at Duckbill, at AWS re:Invent to get Corey’s patented snarky take on all the happenings from the conference.]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:40:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.5 TB of VRAM on Mac Studio - RDMA over Thunderbolt 5</title><link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5/</link><description><![CDATA[<figure class="insert-image"><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5/mac-studio-cluster-1-hero.jpg"

The easiest way to test it is with <a href="https://exolabs.net">Exo 1.0</a>, an open source private AI clustering tool. RDMA lets the Macs all act like they have one giant pool of RAM, which speeds up things like massive AI models.</p>
<p>The stack of Macs I tested, with 1.5 TB of unified memory, costs just shy of $40,000, and if you're wondering, no I cannot justify spending that much money for this. Apple loaned the Mac Studios for testing.
