<p>While most people use Linux on Arm SBCs, it&#8217;s typically possible to run Windows 11 on Arm boards with UEFI support, but with caveats such as the GPU and VPU not working and other issues. One solution is to avoid the Arm architecture altogether and go with an x86 SBC like the Radxa X4, ODROID-H4+, or LattePanda IOTA, among others. But things may change for the better now that Qualcomm SBCs are becoming a thing, and Radxa has just announced official Windows support for the Radxa Dragon Q6A.

<p>Toradex Luna SL1680 is a credit card-sized single board computer heavily inspired by the Raspberry Pi 5 design, but powered by a Synaptics SL1680 quad-core Cortex-A73 SoC suitable for Edge AI applications thanks to a built-in 7.9 TOPS NPU. Designed for pro consumer and light industrial Edge AI applications, the Luna SL1680 ships with up to 4GB RAM and 256GB eMMC flash, and offers many of the same ports as the Pi 5, including a Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 port with optional PoE support, four USB 3.0 ports, two micro HDMI ports (but one Tx, one Rx), MIPI DSI and CSI connectors, and a 40-pin GPIO header. The 16-pin PCIe FFC connector is gone, making way for an M.2 Key-E socket, mostly useful for adding wireless connectivity.

<p>Just a few months back, Wireless-Tag released the WT99P4C5-S1, which combines the ESP32-P4 with an ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 module, instead of the more commonly used ESP32-C6 wireless module found on most ESP32-P4 development boards we’ve covered. The company has now released the WTDKP4C5-S1, a more compact development board built around the WT01P4C5-S1 ESP32-P4 and ESP32-C5 core module. The board supports MIPI-CSI and MIPI-DSI through the ESP32-P4, while the SDIO-connected ESP32-C5 provides dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (2.4/5 GHz) connectivity along with BLE 5, Zigbee, Thread, and Matter. Other features include a USB 2.0 Type-C OTG port, two UART debug interfaces, two 40-pin GPIO breakouts from both chips, and various power options via USB-C, a 12V DC input, or headers. The board is suitable for LVGL-based HMIs, data acquisition, industrial control, and Edge AI applications such as IPCs and smart displays.

<p>Maxell PSB2032 is a rechargeable &#8220;all-solid-state&#8221; coin cell battery for industrial IoT devices, which more than quadruples the capacity of the earlier PSB401010H ceramic-packaged solid-state battery, increasing it from 8mAh to 35mAh. As its name implies, it measures 20 mm in diameter and 3.2 mm in height, and delivers key benefits of solid-state batteries such as a wide discharge temperature range, high reliability, and high safety. It&#8217;s also easier to install than ceramic-packaged batteries requiring reflow soldering, since it comes pre-equipped with two connection terminals suitable for mounting into small-sized devices. The company shared a comparison table between its two solid-state batteries. For reference, the capacity of a typical CR2032 battery is 220–240 mAh, so the PSB2032 has a much lower capacity. However, it can be recharged and works in demanding environments with a wide temperature range and high safety requirements. The last time we wrote about solid-state batteries was [...]</p>

<p>Espressif has just introduced the ESP Private Agents platform to help developers build local, private, and customizable AI assistants for ESP32 devices running on-device, although they can also support hybrid AI workloads with a mix of on-device and cloud processing. The ESP Private Agents platform offers a unified framework that allows developers to build applications combining speed, vision, automation, and agent-based interactions, for example, a multi-lingual, on-device voice agent (aka smart speaker) or task-oriented agents that automate workflows. The solution is built on AWS cloud services using AWS Fargate as a primary application platform and Amazon Bedrock Foundation Models as backend LLM systems. It not only works with ESP32-power devices with speaker and microphone, but also with mobile apps and web clients. Espressif released a Web-based demo, which you can use as a text-based chatbot or as a voice assistant leveraging the speaker and microphone on your computer. The company [...]</p>

<p>Seeed Studio sent us samples of the reTerminal E1001 (monochrome) and E1002 (color) ePaper displays for review. They are powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller providing WiFi and Bluetooth LE wireless connectivity, and are designed for low-power information display applications, consuming power only when updating the screen content. This makes them ideal for tasks requiring long battery life (average of 3 months per charge, depending on how often they are updated) and always-on display capabilities. In this review, we will unbox the devices, go through a teardown, and test them with Seeed Studio&#8217;s SenseCraft no-code HMI platform, as well as ESPHome firmware for Home Assistant integration. reTerminal E1001/E1002 unboxing We received two cardboard packages that look identical and are labeled &#8220;Seeed Studio reTerminal ePaper Display&#8221;.

<p>There are plenty of e-book readers on the market, but the Diptyx E-Reader feels more like a proper book since it features two e-paper displays that can be folded or opened thanks to a custom-made plastic enclosure. While it&#8217;s powered by an ESP32-S3 wireless module with a PCB antenna, both WiFi and Bluetooth are disabled in the firmware, and instead, users can load EPUB files through the reader&#8217;s USB Type-C port. The combination of an automatic standby mode (using deep sleep) and e-ink displays enables the dual-screen device to run for weeks on a single charge. Two buttons are used to access the next or previous page, and a third one powers the device up in a few seconds.

<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>

<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to review three Intel-based UP AI development kits running Ubuntu 24.04 Pro. Last time, I tested the UP TWL SBC with Nx Meta and UP AI Toolkit, and most AI workloads would pass, but since these were running on the Intel N150 CPU or GPU, the performance was not optimal for most. I&#8217;ll now switch to the UP Squared Pro TWL &#8220;mid-range&#8221; AI devkit review with another Intel Processor N150 SBC fitted with a 13 TOPS Hailo-8L M.2 AI accelerator. Both the UP TWL and UP Squared Pro TWL come with a 64GB eMMC flash, and I found out it was rather tight since AI software and models can take a lot of space. The UP Squared Pro TWL has a few M.2 sockets, so I&#8217;ll install an NVMe SSD to expand storage before installing the UP AI toolkit. As usual, I’ll run a few benchmarks and [...]</p>

<p>The 52Pi UPS Gen 6 is another UPS solution for the Raspberry Pi 5 that supports external battery packs for long-duration projects, and uses I²C plus PikaPython scripting to manage power settings and safe shutdowns. Designed for the Raspberry Pi 5 and 4B, the module mounts on the bottom of the board and delivers power via pogo pins. It also includes an aluminum heatsink with an automatic fan for cooling. It runs on two 18650 batteries, which can be mounted to the Pi with spacers, and there is an option to add three more battery packs in parallel if you need longer runtime. The board also features a physical power button for manual control, a 12V power interface for SATA hard drives, and switching hardware (bumpless power transfer) that instantly falls back to battery power so the system stays on during a power outage. 52Pi UPS Gen 6 specifications: Main [...]</p>

<p>But there <em>is</em> a way to hack it.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Out of the box, if you buy a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, install it on the official CM5 IO Board, and install a fan on it (e.g. my current favorite, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/edatec/ED-CM5ACOOLER/25696857">EDAtec CM5 Active Cooler</a>), you'll notice the fan ramps up to 100% speed after you shut down the Pi.</p>

<p>That's not fun, since at least for a couple of my CM5s, they are more often powered down than running, creating a slight cacophany!</p></div>
