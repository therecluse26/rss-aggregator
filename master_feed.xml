<p>The MIPI Alliance has recently released the SoundWire I3S (MIPI SWI3S v1.0) specification for high-bandwidth, low-latency audio applications which unify control and data over a single, power-efficient interface. SWI3S builds upon the two-pin, multi-drop architecture of MIPI SoundWire released in 2014, and offers higher bandwidth, low power consumption, much better noise immunity, and support for scalable multi-device topologies to meet the increasing requirements of embedded audio systems. MIPI SWI3S v1.0 supports data rates up to 76 Mbps against 24 Mbps for the earlier SLIMbus and SoundWire audio interfaces, and improves noise immunity by operating in &#8220;forwarded clock&#8221; or &#8220;differential low voltage signaling&#8221;. It also implements a range of new features such as Hubs, multiple PHY support, control CRC, power-saving techniques, and more. MIPI SoundWire I3S key features: Transports audio data, control commands, interrupt signals, and synchronization information over a unified two-pin link Forwarded bit clock single-ended (FBCSE) and differential low-voltage [...]</p>

<p>When it comes to ESP32-based WLED controllers, some of the best options are boards like the Adafruit Sparkle Motion, Mini Sparkle Motion, and Sparkle Motion Stick, but most of the time, they are out of stock. Thankfully, there are similar alternatives like the xChroma WLED Type-C and HACK Lab HackLED Pro, with similar features and wider availability. Now adding to that list is the 2-Port ESP32 ETH0 WLED Controller, which not only adds Ethernet connectivity but also supports dual outputs and 5V–24V LEDs, making it an excellent alternative to the Adafruit ones. The board supports both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connectivity and includes an onboard DC-DC converter that delivers a stable 5V supply to the ESP32 and logic circuits. Each output channel is fused with a 6A resettable polyfuse and a status LED that lights up during fault conditions. For added safety, the main power input is protected against reverse polarity, [...]</p>

<p>We’re going to do a quick review of smart outdoor motorised shades from Weffort — another brand that makes smart shades compatible with popular Smart Home platforms, including Home Assistant, SmartThings, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Amazon Alexa. The cool thing about Weffort’s shades is that everything’s fully customisable and made-to-order — from the fabric and motors to casing styles, size, and the Smart Home platform you want to use with. With various options, it might sound complicated at first (usually people just let a pro handle it), but it’s actually way easier than you think. Plus, the shades are lightweight, so you can totally install them by yourself. Custom-made shades Before we got the test unit from Weffort, they let us locate a good spot for installation and testing so that we could take measurements following the guide on their website, which also has tips on choosing materials, installation, measurements, [...]</p>

<p>Qualcomm has just signed an agreement to acquire Arduino, and the goal of the purchase is to &#8220;combine Qualcomm’s leading-edge products and technologies with Arduino’s vast ecosystem and community to empower businesses, students, entrepreneurs, tech professionals, educators, and enthusiasts to quickly and easily bring ideas to life.&#8221; They also took the opportunity to launch the Arduino UNO Q &#8220;dual-brain&#8221; SBC powered by a Qualcomm DragonWing QRB2210 SoC running Linux and an STMicro STM32U585 MCU for real-time control, as well as the Arduino App Lab integrated development environment to &#8220;unify the Arduino journey across Real‑time OS, Linux, Python, and AI flows&#8221;. Will the acquisition change anything? I suppose we&#8217;ll see more and more Arduino boards based on Qualcomm processors, but the company also promises to preserve Arduino&#8217;s open approach and community: Arduino will retain its independent brand, tools, and mission, while continuing to support a wide range of microcontrollers and microprocessors [...]</p>

<p>wafer.space has launched its first pooled silicon fabrication run on Crowd Supply, called the GF180MCU Run 1, which enables designers, engineers, and companies to create 1,000 custom ASICs using GlobalFoundries’ 180 nm mixed-signal process.  Each slot provides a fixed 3.88 × 5.07 mm (19.67 mm²) die area replicated 1,000 times, meaning you will receive 1000 chips, with options for bare dies or chip-on-board packaging. The GF180MCU process supports 5 metal layers, MIM capacitors (~2.0 fF/µm²), poly and high-res poly resistors, and standard-Vt MOS devices. Users can handle their own pad ring, ESD, and I/O layout while wafer.space manages fabrication, dicing, and shipping from Singapore. Designs can be open or closed source, and full wafers are also available for advanced testing or collection. Designs are submitted to wafer.space as GDSII files (the standard file format for chip layouts). Wafer.space automatically checks these files to make sure they can be manufactured correctly.

<p>Since Debian 13 &#8220;Trixie&#8221; was released last August, it was just a matter of time until Raspberry Pi OS followed. Raspberry Pi announced the update from Bookworm to Trixie a few days ago. The new Raspberry Pi OS images get the new and updated packages from Debian 13, and features like 64-bit time support to solve the Y2K38 bug. However, as Simon Long, UX engineer at Raspberry Pi, points out, there have been fewer changes in newer versions of Debian, and most changes in the new version of Pi OS are cosmetic, although there are some interesting under-the-hood changes as well. The most obvious change from the user&#8217;s perspective is the new theme featuring a completely new set of icons, a new font (Nunito Sans Light), new desktop backgrounds (the new default is a photo of the sun rising over the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho), and some other small tweaks.

<p>Instead of a traditional review of a new Pi product, I thought I'd split things up on my blog, and write two separate posts; this one about the Pi 500+'s new mechanical keyboard, and a separate post about <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/full-egpu-acceleration-on-pi-500-15-line-patch">hacking in an eGPU on the Pi 500+</a>, for a massive uplift in gaming performance and local LLMs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-500-plus/">Raspberry Pi 500+</a> was announced today, sells for $200, and adds on the following over what was present in the regular Pi 500:</p></div>
