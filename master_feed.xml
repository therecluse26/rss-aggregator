<p>Waveshare PCIE TO 4-CH Gigabit/2.5G ETH Board (B) is a 4-port Gigabit or 2.5 Gbps Ethernet board designed for the Raspberry Pi 5. This board connects four RJ45 ports to the Pi&#8217;s 16-pin PCIe interface and also includes a mounting option for the Pi5 Connector Adapter (C). The only limiting factor is the Pi&#8217;s PCIe Gen2/Gen3 x1 interface, as the 2.5GbE ports share the available bandwidth and cannot operate at full speed simultaneously. The Gigabit Ethernet variant features Realtek RTL8153 USB to Ethernet controllers, while the 2.5GbE variant relies on RTL8156 controllers, and both integrate a VL805 PCIe to USB bridge chip.

<p>Forlinx has recently released the FET1126Bx-S, a low-power SoM, which is based on the Rockchip RV1126B (commercial) or RV1126BJ (industrial) SoC. Designed for edge AI applications, the module is suitable for smart cameras, AIoT gateways, and intelligent monitoring systems where local video analytics, low power consumption, and long-term stability are required. It is easy to confuse the newer RV1126B/RV1126BJ with the original Rockchip RV1126, a 32-bit Cortex-A7-based SoC announced around 2020–2021. However, the newer RV1126B/BJ comes with a significant architectural upgrade with a 64-bit quad-core Arm Cortex-A53 processor (instead of the original 32-bit quad-core Cortex-A7) and a more powerful 3.0 TOPS NPU (up from 2.0 TOPS). This updated chip has only recently started appearing in products like Luckfox Aura SBC, Boardcon MINI1126B-P SoM (based on the RV1126B-P), GL.iNet Comet PoE, and GL.iNet Comet Pro KVMs, all of which were released just this year. This makes the FET1126Bx-S SoM one of the [...]</p>

<p>M5Stack NanoH2 is an ultra-compact, standalone IoT development kit powered by an Espressif Systems&#8217; ESP32-H2 wireless SoC with support for Zigbee, Thread, and Matter, and designed for smart home and low-power wireless applications. It also features a built-in LED, an RGB LED, an infrared transmitter, a Grove port for expansion, a user button, and a USB-C port for power and programming. On the surface, it looks very similar to the Unit Gateway H2 introduced last March, with an ESP32-H2 SoC and a Grove connector.

<p>OpenMediaVault 8, or OMV8 for shorts, codenamed &#8220;Synchrony&#8221; has been released, now supporting only 64-bit architectures (AMD64 and ARM64), and dropping 32-bit systems based on the i386, armel, and armhf architectures. OpenMediaVault is a popular, open-source network-attached storage (NAS) solution based on Debian Linux that&#8217;s been around for many years. I had my first experience with it in 2017 when I reviewed FriendlyELEC NanoPi NEO NAS Kit based on a NanoPi NEO2 SBC with an Allwinner H5 64-bit Cortex A53 SoC, but sadly not recommended for OMV8 (more on that below). The main reason for killing 32-bit support is that the Salt Project only supports 64-bit builds. OpenMediaVault 8 highlights: Upgrade to Debian 13 (Trixie). Replace cpufrequtils with linux-cpupower Improve several user and group-related RPCs. Developers should note that the RPCs UserMgmt::enumerateSystemUsers, UserMgmt::enumerateUsers, UserMgmt::enumerateAllUsers and UserMgmt::getUserList now return only basic user information.

<p>Their facility in Boulder Colorado just had its power cut for multiple days. After a backup generator failed, their main ensemble clock lost track of UTC, or Universal Time Coordinated.</p>

<p>But even if you used the <a href="https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi">NTP timing servers they run</a>, they were never off by more than 5 microseconds.</p>

<p>5 μs might seem insignificant. But it <em>is</em> significant for scientists and universities who rely on NIST's more <a href="https://wsts.atis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/04-Judah-Levine.The-NIST-Fiber-Based-Time-Service.pdf">specialized timing signals</a>.</p>

<p>But no, you don't need to panic. And yes, they have it under control now.</p>

<p>But I thought I'd go over what happened, what it means, and what we can learn from NIST's near-outage.</p>

<p>ESP-Scope is an open-source firmware transforming any ESP32 board into an oscilloscope using one of the ADC pins up to 83,333 Hz sample rate (on the ESP32-C6) and visualizing the results over Wi-Fi in a web browser, be it Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or others. It&#8217;s not the first ESP32 oscilloscope project we&#8217;ve seen, as last year, we covered Bojan Jurca’s “Esp32_oscilloscope” Arduino sketch doing something very similar. The ESP-Scope is a little different, since it&#8217;s based on the ESP-IDF framework, and was used to test AI code generators, specifically &#8220;Google Antigravity using Gemini 3, with refinements, hints and tips and overall design specified by a human&#8221;.

<p>Seeed Studio sent us a review sample of the XIAO Soil Moisture Sensor powered by the XIAO ESP32C6 wireless module and running on a single AA battery. Designed for ultra-low power consumption, it&#8217;s supposed to offer long-lasting operation with dynamic adjustment of monitoring intervals. It&#8217;s preloaded with ESPHome firmware and is fully compatible with Home Assistant. It&#8217;s ideal for indoor plants monitoring, but it can&#8217;t be used outdoors since the 3D printed enclosure is not weatherproof. In this review, we&#8217;ll start with an unboxing, do a quick teardown, and test it with Home Assistant to receive a notification on our smartphone when the soil is dry.

<p>Ever since I got <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/using-amd-gpus-on-raspberry-pi-without-recompiling-linux">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/all-intel-gpus-run-on-raspberry-pi-and-risc-v">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia</a> graphics cards to run on a Raspberry Pi, I had a nagging question:</p>

<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s. Not a fair fight.</p></div>

<p>This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.</p>

<p>But you can't get one. Well, not unless you buy the <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>

<p>This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.</p>

<p>Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you 'plug in' to another board, to give it life.</p></div>

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>

<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>

<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I finally upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. But because Apple's so protective of their Touch ID hardware, there aren't any mechanical keyboards with that feature built in.</p>

<p>But there <em>is</em> a way to hack it. It's incredibly wasteful, and takes a bit more patience than I think <em>most</em> people have, but you basically take an Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, rip out the Touch ID, and install it in a 3D printed box, along with the keyboard's logic board.</p></div>

This week, GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-kernel-modules/pull/972">@mariobalanica dropped this (larger) patch which does the same for Nvidia GPUs</a>!</p>
