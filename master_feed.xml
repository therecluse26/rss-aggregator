<p>We often write about breadboard-friendly boards, which typically means they plug nicely into a breadboard, but usually leave only one or two rows to play with on each side. So far, the best option we have come across is probably the Raspberry Breadstick, which is designed for full-length breadboards, but is limited by the I/Os on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU. When it comes to breadboard friendliness, it&#8217;s hard to beat The Pi Hut&#8217;s Baguette S3, as it provides a single 30-pin header designed to be inserted in one of the rows of a breadboard, leaving plenty of space for prototyping. The board also features an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, a microSD card slot, a USB-C for power and programming, a Qwiic port for further expansion, an RGB LED, and RESET and BOOT buttons. Baguette S3 specifications: Wireless module – ESP32-S3-MINI-1-N8 module SoC &#8211; ESP32-S3 dual-core Xtensa LX7 processor with WiFi 4 [...]</p>

But due to the timing of the Linux 6.17 release around late September and the Ubuntu 25.10 kernel freeze around the same time, it's led to some confusion with committing to a Linux 6.17-rc or potentially some suggesting Ubuntu 25.10 would ship with a Linux 6.16 kernel and then ship v6.17 as a stable release update. Well, the situation is more clear with Linux 6.17 having been merged now as the default kernel of Ubuntu 25.10...]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2025 00:39:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bambu Lab’s PLA Tough+ Filament: Mostly a Tough Sell</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/09/09/bambu-labs-pla-tough-filament-mostly-a-tough-sell/</link><description><![CDATA[<div><img width="800" height="443" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?w=800" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 15px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg 1335w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?resize=250,138 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?resize=400,221 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?resize=800,443 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-attachment-id="815425" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2025/09/09/bambu-labs-pla-tough-filament-mostly-a-tough-sell/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg" data-orig-size="1335,739" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="bambu_lab_pla_tough+_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/bambu_lab_pla_tough_vs_regular_my_tech_fun_youtube.jpg?w=800" /></div>Beyond the simple world of basic PLA filaments there is a whole wild world of additives that can change this humble material for better or worse.

<p>Formuler Z12 Ultra is an Android 12 4K TV box powered by a Realtek RTD1319C SoC coupled with 4GB RAM and 128GB eMMC flash, support for Dolby Vision and Atmos, and popular USB ATSC or DVB-T/T2 digital TV tuners. While it was first seen in 2022 on the Formuler Z11 Pro Max, the RTD1319C is new to me, and it appears to be a variant of the RTD1319 quad-core Cortex-A55 SoC introduced in 2020, which replaces an entry-level Mali-G31 MP2 with an older, mid-range Mali-G57 MC1 GPU that should allow for smoother or higher-resolution user interfaces.

<p>After being on the platform since 2006 (though for me, not being a 'professional' YouTuber until about 5 years ago), I'm used to seasonal dips, adjustments after new tweaks to the algorithm or layout/design changes.</p>

<p>But this was <em>substantial</em>.</p>

<p>I had 4 10/10 videos <em>in a row</em>, which is unprecedented. I mean, my content could just be terrible all the sudden, and I've lost all but my core audience. But there are other explanations.

<p>Realtek introduced the RTL8127 10GbE to PCIe NIC at Computex 2025 last May as a low-power, low-cost 10Gbps Ethernet solution for PCIe and M.2 networking cards with an estimated price of around $30 to $40. The good news is that 10GbE PCIe and M.2 cards are now available for sale, just not always at the expected price points. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the options available.

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>

<p>Libre Computer has just announced the general availability of EtherealOS for the company&#8217;s Amlogic SBCs, namely AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato), AML-S805X-AC (La Frite), AML-S905X-CC-V2 ( Sweet Potato), AML-S905D3-CC (Solitude), and AML-A311D-CC (Alta). EtherealOS is described as a lightweight internet-booted operating system designed for performing tasks such as file and disk manipulation, operating system deployment, light browser tasks, and more. It includes a limited set of tools compared to a full operating system, and it&#8217;s basically an OS to install other operating systems directly from the Internet, in a way similar to Khadas OOWOW or Radxa ROOBI OS. The difference is that EtherealOS apparently supports upstreamed operating systems, namely Debian (debian-12.11.0-arm64-DVD-1.iso / debian-testing-arm64-DVD-1.iso), Fedora (Fedora-Workstation-Live-42-1.1.aarch64.iso), and OpenSUSE, besides images optimized by Libre Computer based on Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspbian.

<p>TerraMaster has sent me the D1 SSD Plus portable SSD enclosure for review, and helped me get a 2TB WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD for testing, since the PCIe Gen4 x4 storage device reached up 7,300 MB/s to sequential read speeds, and 6,600 MB/s sequential write speeds, well beyond the 40Gbps capabilities of the enclosure. I had reviewed two ORICO NVMe enclosures previously, namely the ORICO COM2-T3 and ORICO M234C3-U4, which were both based on an Intel JH7440 Thunderbolt 3 chip. I tested the COM2-T3 up to 3166.71 MB/s with a fast SSD, but TerraMaster claims up to 3,853MB/s sequential read speed and 3,707 MB/s sequential write speed with a 4TB Samsung 990 PRO SSD, while connected to an Apple M4 Pro Mac mini (MacOS version 15.3.2) using AJA System Test software.

<p>LWMalloc is an ultra-lightweight dynamic memory allocator designed for embedded systems that is said to outperform ptmalloc used in Glibc, achieving up to 53% faster execution time and 23% lower memory usage. Malloc can cause memory fragmentation on embedded systems, potentially leading to crashes after the firmware runs long enough. Garbage collection is one technique for lowering fragmentation, but it&#8217;s not always practical on resource-constrained devices, and some simply avoid using malloc in their firmware, preferring static memory allocation or memory pools to improve reliability. Custom dynamic memory allocators are another option, and that&#8217;s what LWMalloc provides. LWMalloc is described in a paper entitled &#8220;LWMalloc: A Lightweight Dynamic Memory Allocator for Resource-Constrained Environments&#8221; as follows: LWMalloc incorporates a lightweight data structure, a deferred coalescing (DC) policy, and dedicated small chunk pools to optimize memory allocation. The lightweight data structure minimizes metadata overhead, ensuring a compact and efficient implementation. The DC [...]</p>

<p>AAEON MIX-MTLD1 is an industrial Mini-ITX motherboard supporting out-of-band (OOB) management and powered by an Intel Core Ultra Meteor Lake H/U processor (Intel Core Ultra 5 125H by default). The board supports up to 96 GB of DDR5-5600 memory, PCIe Gen 5 expansion, dual LAN, and various I/O options, including seven USB and four COM headers, and has a design fairly similar to the Jetway MTX-ARH1 released last week, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H or Core Ultra 7 155H SoC. What makes the MIX-MTLD1 different is the NCSI header for out-of-band (OOB) management using a MOD-RMB module, which links the Ethernet controller to a BMC for remote monitoring and control independently of the OS running on the CPU. This feature is common in servers, but more rare in industrial Mini-ITX boards, although we previously covered the DFI RPS101/RPS103 mini-ITX motherboards and HoneyComb Ryzen V3000 motherboard featuring OOB management [...]</p>

<p>Today, we’ll do a quick review of the new SONOFF CAM-PT2 indoor camera, which is the third model after the Slim Gen2 (CAM S2) fixed-angle camera and the Slim camera, both of which we reviewed previously. The CAM-PT2 (CAM Pan-Tilt 2) supports Pan/Tilt/Zoom functions. Its main features are quite similar to the CAM S2, including 1080p resolution, Motion Detection/AI Human Detection, and Privacy Zone support. In addition to Pan/Tilt, it adds new features such as the ability to set Preset Points to remember specific camera positions. It’s also the first SONOFF camera to support ONVIF, on top of RTSP, which has been available since the CAM S2. Let’s take a closer look at the details. SONOFF CAM-PT2 unboxing Inside the white box, you’ll find the camera itself, a mini manual, a USB-C cable, wall plugs with screws, a drilling sticker, and a camera holder.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

<p>This Classic was handed to me alongside my Uncle Mark's Apple II, which I'll probably cover later (we've played a game of whack-a-mole with issues on that machine! Well worth it but I haven't hit a point where enough things are working to cover it well, heh).</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>
