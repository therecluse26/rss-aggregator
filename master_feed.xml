<p>Forlinx Embedded FET3506J-C is an ultra-small system-on-module (SoM) based on Rockchip RK3506J triple-core Cortex-A7 SoC measuring just 40 x 29mm, and equipped with up to 512MB DDR3, and 256MB NAND flash, or 8GB eMMC flash. I first thought I had already written about it, but the Forlinx FET3506J-S module introduced last March has a different design. It measures 44 x 35mm and exposes all I/Os through castellated holes, while the FET3506J-C features two 80-pin board-to-board (B2B) connectors instead.

<p>For hobbyists, small businesses, and engineers in Europe and the United States, prototyping printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a critical step in turning innovative ideas into reality. However, one significant barrier often stands in the way: high shipping costs. These expenses can quickly inflate the total cost of small-scale PCB orders, making prototyping less accessible for individuals and startups with limited budgets. Few PCB manufacturers offer significant discounts on small-scale orders, and shipping fees can sometimes rival or even exceed the cost of the PCBs themselves, discouraging experimentation and innovation. To address this issue, ALLPCB, a leading PCB manufacturing and assembly provider, has launched an exciting new campaign designed to make PCB prototyping more affordable for everyone. New users can now enjoy $30 off their first PCB order, plus an additional $30 off shipping costs. What sets this offer apart is its flexibility—there are no limitations on PCB size, number [...]</p>

<p>TrueNAS Scale NAS platform was designed to work on x86-64 computers only, but there&#8217;s now an unofficial port for 64-bit Arm (Aarch64) targets running a UEFI bootloader, including the Raspberry Pi 4/5 SBCs and other higher-end Arm boards. Previously known as FreeNAS, the community edition, FreeBSD-based TrueNAS Core was phased out in 2022 and replaced with the Linux-based TrueNAS Scale. iXsystems also provides TrueNAS Enterprise, a paid version with more advanced features, but all versions only work on 64-bit x86 machines. TrueNAS forum user Joel0 decided to change that and patched TrueNAS Scale to run on ARM (aarch64). The main requirements are having a 64-bit Arm target, at least 8GB RAM, 16GB boot storage, and a working UEFI bootloader. The image has been tested with a QEMU virtual machine, and it should also work on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with UEFI, but it has not been tested. One [...]</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>ArmSoM RK3588 AI Module7 (AIM7) is a Rockchip RK3588 system-on-module compatible with NVIDIA Jetson Nano and other 260-pin SO-DIMM Jetson modules, so you should be able to use it with a wide range of Jetson carrier boards.  It is designed for edge computing, AI inference, VR/AR, smart NVR systems, and general-purpose applications. The RK3588 AIM7 ships with 4GB to 32GB RAM, 32GB to 128GB eMMC flash, and integrates a Rockchip RK806-1 PMIC, but no Gigabit Ethernet controller as found on the competing Mixtile Core 3588E. While the RK3588 SoM should work on most Jetson carrier boards, ArmSoM has also designed the AIM-IO carrier board to quickly get started with the module. RK3588 AI Module7 specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3588 CPU – Octa-core processor with 4x Arm Cortex-A76 cores @ up to 2.4 GHz, 4x Arm Cortex-A55 cores @ 1.8 GHz GPU – Arm Mali-G610 MP4 GPU with support for OpenGL [...]</p>

<p>Renasas RA4C1 microcontroller (MCU) group is based on an 80-MHz Arm Cortex M33 core and designed for utility meters and battery-powered IoT applications. It&#8217;s especially suited to devices that require advanced security and segment LCD support, such as smart locks, thermostats, building controls, and industrial user interfaces. The RA4C1 is very similar to the Renesas RA4L1 MCU designed for HMI applications, but it comes with more RAM (96KB vs 64KB), and being optimized for Smart Meters lacks features like capacitive touch and audio output.

<p>Waveshare ESP32-P4-ETH is a compact ESP32-P4 development board with Ethernet and PoE support, which looks very similar to the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit minus the pUEXT connector. However, we&#8217;ve also covered other ESP32-P4 boards with Ethernet (and other features) such as the ESP32-P4-Module-DEV-KIT, the ESP32-P4-NANO board, and the GUITION JC-ESP32P4-M3-DEV. Design wise, the board also looks very similar to the Wiznet boards based on Raspberry Pi RP2xxx microcontroller such as the W55RP20-EVB-Pico, the W6300-EVB-Pico2, and the W5100S-EVB-Pico2 boards, but you can also run multimedia workloads with MIPI camera and display interfaces, hardware video encoding, audio processing, AI speech functions, and advanced security features on the ESP32-P4-ETH board.

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve just come across a no-name non-contact, high-precision 80 GHz mmWave radar sensor for liquid level detection with a 40m range, ±5mm accuracy, and Modbus communication over UART. We had seen 24 GHz and 60 GHz mmWave sensors mostly for precise motion detection, but it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen an 80 GHz mmWave sensor, or more exactly, 79 GHz. It operates on the same principle of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar as most other mmWave sensors and connects to an Arduino or other board over UART. It targets applications such as smart water management, industrial process control, and environmental disaster prevention/monitoring.

<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) released the Matter 1.4 specification in fall 2024, and we skipped Matter 1.4.1 here, but decided to cover the Matter 1.4.2 release, which enables WiFi only provisioning, removing the need for a Bluetooth LE radio often only used for onboarding Smart Home devices. This will enable device makers to reduce costs and hardware complexity by removing the Bluetooth LE radio and the associated software stack in designs where a BLE radio is only used solely for commissioning. While Matter 1.4.2 is a minor dot release, it includes many other changes we&#8217;ll cover below. Matter 1.4.2 highlights: Wi-Fi Only Commissioning &#8211;  Relies on Wi-Fi Unsynchronized Service Discovery (USD), and removes the need for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radios to onboard devices to the Matter ecosystems.

<p>Raspberry Pi introduced the 7-inch Touch Display 2 with 1280&#215;720 resolution and a thinner design last November. The company has now introduced a 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 that sells for $40 instead of $60 for the 7-inch model. Besides the smaller dimensions, nothing much else changed, as the 5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 keeps the same 1280&#215;720 resolution, 5-point multi-touch capacitive support, 24-bit RGB format, and so on. One difference is the viewing angle: 80° for the new 5-inch model, and 85° for the 7-inch variant.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>
