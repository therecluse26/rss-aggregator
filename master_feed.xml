<p>TACNIQ Backy is an AI-enabled wearable monitoring device designed to reduce workplace injuries caused by improper lifting and posture, based on a Nordic nRF52840 wireless microcontroller and a 6-point piezo-resistive sensor array measuring direct force sensing. While most ergonomic tools rely on motion tracking or vision-based systems, Backy relies on direct force sensing and embedded AI inference, and the company claims it provides real-time, direct strain detection at a lower cost than competing solutions while keeping costs low and precision high.

Today, I&#8217;ll go through an unboxing, a (partial) teardown, and have a quick try with the default firmware and GUI, before checking out how to program the device in the second part of the review. M5Stack Tab5 unboxing I received the Tab5 in its retail package along with an M5Stack-branded transparent sticky tape roll. Not sure why, but thanks M5Stack, sticky tape is always useful, so appreciated! The bottom side of the package has all the key features and specifications that we already covered in our article about the Tab5. The package contains the Tab5 itself, a 2,000mAh/14.8Wh battery, and a cable with six wires for the ExtPort2 [...]</p>

<p>SiFli SF23LB52J is a Bluetooth 5.3 microcontroller part of the SF32LB52x family with two Cortex-M33 in big.LITTLE configuration with a 240 MHz high-performance core for user application/GUI and a 24 MHz low-power core to manage the Bluetooth part. A few months ago, Eric Migicovsky, the founder of the smartwatch company Pebble, and now Core Devices, introduced the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 smartwatches running PebbleOS open-source firmware that were mostly relaunches of the never-released Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 with some tweaks. We already knew the Core 2 Duo would be based on a Nordic nRF52840 Arm Cortex-M4F microcontroller, however, the one for the Core Time 2 was kept secret. That&#8217;s until today, as Eric has just announced that the Core Time 2 would be based on the SiFli SF23LB52J MCU, since the smartwatch required an MCU with more RAM and processing power, and SiFli also offers [...]</p>

<p>Michael Opdenacker, Founder of Root Commit, has published free and open-source training materials on OpenEmbedded and Yocto using the BeaglePlay SBC powered by a Texas Instruments AM625 processor. If the name rings a bell, it&#8217;s because Michael was the founder of Bootlin (previously Free Electrons) before selling the company to employees in 2021. He&#8217;s now started a new company called Root Commit, where he continues providing Embedded Linux training and development services. He&#8217;s kept the tradition of releasing free training materials, with the latest course being related to Yocto development on the BeaglePlay board. You&#8217;ll find resources on the Root Commit website with three files, including 220 pages of lectures, 18 practical labs for the BeaglePlay board and QEMU, and source code/patchsets released under a Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license.

<p>The PicoEMP is a compact, low-cost, open-source electromagnetic fault injector (EMFI) tool developed by Colin O&#8217;Flynn for researchers, hobbyists, and educators interested in hardware security. Unlike NewAE’s professional-grade ChipSHOUTER, PicoEMP is a bare-bones device designed to be safe, usable, and most importantly, affordable. Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico, this device generates high-voltage pulses using a transformer circuit (originally for photographic flash charging) to discharge energy from a low-ESR ceramic capacitor into a custom-made coil tip, which creates an electromagnetic field capable of injecting a little bit of power to the internals of the processors such as registers and SRAM. This can be exploited to flip bits and test the robustness of embedded systems against such attacks.

<p>Bitcoin mining now requires expensive machines, so I was surprised when I saw the Lucky Miner SOLO-LV02 cryptocurrency mining &#8220;machine&#8221; going for about $24 on AliExpress (link at the end of this post). The USB-powered box is capable of mining coins with the SHA-256 algorithm, and features a 1.9-inch display, WiFi connectivity, and two buttons. In theory, we&#8217;re told the device can mine BTC, BCH, BSV, DGB&#8230; Considering the really low hashrate, it&#8217;s the equivalent of a lottery ticket for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, and the luckiest ones may get one Bitcoin block (3.125 BTC).

<p>Elecrow ThinkNode M2 is yet another Meshtastic handset for off-grid messaging and GPS coordinate sharing based on an ESP32-S3 module providing Bluetooth connectivity to a smartphone, and a Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver for low-power long-range wireless connectivity. It&#8217;s an evolution of the ThinkNode-M1, itself similar to the LILYGO T-Echo, based on a Nordic Semi nRF52840 Bluetooth module and SX1262 LoRa transceiver with an external antenna housed in a 3D printed enclosure. The new ThinkNode M2 is very similar but features a more powerful ESP32-S3 module instead, relies on a 1.3-inch OLED display instead of a 1.54-inch e-paper display, and is housed in an ABS plastic case.

<p>The MIPI Alliance has recently released the MIPI C-PHY v3.0 specification, defining the physical layer for connecting cameras and displays. The main change in MIPI C-PHY Version 3.0 is the addition of an 18-Wirestate mode encoding option &#8211; instead of the 6-Wirestate mode encoding used in previous versions &#8211; that increases the maximum performance of a C-PHY lane by approximately 30 to 35 percent. The MIPI Alliance claims this enhancement delivers up to 75 Gbps over a short channel for ultra-high-resolution image sensors. The table below shows the key features and differences between versions of the MIPI C-PHY specification. Interestingly, the symbol rate decreased for MIPI C-PHY v3.0 compared to v2.1 (7.0 Gsps vs 8.0 Gsps for short channel), but the data rate increased from 18.3 to 24.9 Gbps, a 36% increase, due to the more efficient encoding option 32b9s that transports 32 bits over nine symbols (3.56 bits per symbol) while maintaining [...]</p>

<p>The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) has just adopted the Bluetooth 6.1 Core Specification with the addition of the randomized Resolvable Private Address (RPA) Updates feature and several errata. The Randomized RPA updates feature is designed to enhance privacy and power efficiency in Bluetooth devices by randomizing the timing of address changes to make it much more difficult for third parties to track or correlate device activity over time, and offloading the address change operation to the Controller to help the Bluetooth device extend its battery life. That&#8217;s about all there is for Bluetooth 6.1, except some errata like &#8220;Pause Encryption should be mandatory to support with encryption&#8221;. You&#8217;ll find the latest specification on the Bluetooth website, as well as a page specific to Randomized RPA Updates.

<p>HydraLink is a compact USB-to-Automotive Ethernet dongle that supports 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 standards over a single twisted pair (no large RJ45 connector needed) and provides a solution for diagnosing, testing, and prototyping automotive networks. The rationale behind HydraLink is that the automotive sector is undergoing a shift from CAN-based systems to advanced Automotive Ethernet networks like BroadR-Reach (802.3bw) that allow multiple in-vehicle systems to simultaneously access information over unshielded single twisted pair cables.  So as I understand it, the HydraLink is the modern equivalent of OBD-II USB scanners relying on Ethernet instead.

<p>Walnut Pi 2B is a single board computer (SBC) powered by an Allwinner T527 octa-core Cortex-A55 SoC with a built-in 2 TOPS AI accelerator that closely follows the Raspberry Pi 5 design for compatibility with most HAT+ expansion boards and accessories. The Walnut Pi 2B SBC ships with 1GB to 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, an optional 32GB eMMC flash, and features a microSD card slot, gigabit Ethernet, four USB ports, a WiFI and Bluetooth module, MIPI DSI/CSI connectors, and the same PCIe FFC connector as found on the Raspberry Pi 5, and a 40-pin GPIO. One of the most obvious differences is that it only comes with one micro HDMI port instead of two on the Pi 5. Let&#8217;s check out the specifications to find other changes.

<p>SO-ARM101 &#8220;Arm Servo Motor Kit&#8221; is an open-source dual robotic arm kit that works with Hugging Face&#8217;s LeRobot robotics framework and is designed to interface with NVIDIA Jetson AI modules and computers. It is an update to the SO-ARM100 DIY open-source robotic arm kit introduced last year with LeRobot framework support. The new SO-ARM101 is still comprised of leader and follower arms but features improved wiring to prevent disconnection issues previously seen at joint 3, motors with optimized gear ratios, and a few functionality where the leader arm can now follow the follower arm in real-time, which will be used for reinforcement learning (RL) where a human can intervene and correct the robot’s actions. SO-ARM101 specifications: Degrees of Freedom (DOF) – 6 per Arm Motor control Total servo – 12x STS3215 bus servos (6x for each Arm) Leader Arm 1x (7.4V) 1:345 gear ratio motor for No.2 joints 2x (7.4V) [...]</p>
