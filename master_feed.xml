<p>The Government of India has been investing to spur up its semiconductor design and manufacturing industry at least since 2018/2019 with the SHAKTI and AJIT microprocessors. In 2022, they decided to focus on the RISC-V architecture with the VEGA processor family, starting with the THEJAS32 (VEGA ET1031) and THEJAS64 (VEGA AS1061) microprocessors, and the former was eventually found in the ARIES v3.0 Arduino UNO-inspired development board. Things continue to progress nicely, albeit slowly, and the government has now announced the launch of the DHRUV64 (VEGA AS2161) dual-core 64-bit RISC-V MPU clocked at 1 GHz and supporting Linux, which it describes as &#8220;a fully indigenous microprocessor developed by the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) under the Microprocessor Development Programme (MDP)&#8221;.

<p>Espressif has just introduced the ESP Private Agents platform to help developers build local, private, and customizable AI assistants for ESP32 devices running on-device, although they can also support hybrid AI workloads with a mix of on-device and cloud processing. The ESP Private Agents platform offers a unified framework that allows developers to build applications combining speed, vision, automation, and agent-based interactions, for example, a multi-lingual, on-device voice agent (aka smart speaker) or task-oriented agents that automate workflows. The solution is built on AWS cloud services using AWS Fargate as a primary application platform and Amazon Bedrock Foundation Models as backend LLM systems.

<p>Seeed Studio sent us samples of the reTerminal E1001 (monochrome) and E1002 (color) ePaper displays for review. They are powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller providing WiFi and Bluetooth LE wireless connectivity, and are designed for low-power information display applications, consuming power only when updating the screen content. This makes them ideal for tasks requiring long battery life (average of 3 months per charge, depending on how often they are updated) and always-on display capabilities. In this review, we will unbox the devices, go through a teardown, and test them with Seeed Studio&#8217;s SenseCraft no-code HMI platform, as well as ESPHome firmware for Home Assistant integration. reTerminal E1001/E1002 unboxing We received two cardboard packages that look identical and are labeled &#8220;Seeed Studio reTerminal ePaper Display&#8221;.

<p>This little postage stamp is actually a full Raspberry Pi Zero 2, complete with eMMC storage and WiFi.</p>

<p>But you can't get one. Well, not unless you buy the <a href="https://edatec.cn/docs/cm0nano/ds/">CM0NANO development board from EDAtec</a>, or you live in China.</p>

<p>This little guy doesn't have an HDMI port, Ethernet, or even USB. It's a special version of the 'Compute Module' line of boards. Little Raspberry Pi 'System on Modules' (SoMs), they're called.</p>

<p>Compute Modules are entire Linux computers about the size of a regular desktop CPU that you 'plug in' to another board, to give it life.</p></div>

<p>There are plenty of e-book readers on the market, but the Diptyx E-Reader feels more like a proper book since it features two e-paper displays that can be folded or opened thanks to a custom-made plastic enclosure. While it&#8217;s powered by an ESP32-S3 wireless module with a PCB antenna, both WiFi and Bluetooth are disabled in the firmware, and instead, users can load EPUB files through the reader&#8217;s USB Type-C port. The combination of an automatic standby mode (using deep sleep) and e-ink displays enables the dual-screen device to run for weeks on a single charge. Two buttons are used to access the next or previous page, and a third one powers the device up in a few seconds.

<p>Now that <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia GPUs run on the Raspberry Pi</a>, I've been putting all the ones I own through their paces.</p>

<p>Many people have an older Nvidia card (like a 3060) laying around from an upgrade. So could a Pi be suitable for GPU-accelerated video transcoding, either standalone for conversion, or running something like Jellyfin for video library management and streaming?</p>

<p>That's what I set out to do, and the first step, besides getting the drivers and CUDA going (see blog post linked above), was to find a way to get a repeatable benchmark going.</p></div>

<p>I&#8217;ve been asked to review three Intel-based UP AI development kits running Ubuntu 24.04 Pro. Last time, I tested the UP TWL SBC with Nx Meta and UP AI Toolkit, and most AI workloads would pass, but since these were running on the Intel N150 CPU or GPU, the performance was not optimal for most. I&#8217;ll now switch to the UP Squared Pro TWL &#8220;mid-range&#8221; AI devkit review with another Intel Processor N150 SBC fitted with a 13 TOPS Hailo-8L M.2 AI accelerator. Both the UP TWL and UP Squared Pro TWL come with a 64GB eMMC flash, and I found out it was rather tight since AI software and models can take a lot of space. The UP Squared Pro TWL has a few M.2 sockets, so I&#8217;ll install an NVMe SSD to expand storage before installing the UP AI toolkit. As usual, I’ll run a few benchmarks and [...]</p>

<p>After the release of the high-performance EPYC Embedded 9005, AMD has now introduced the EPYC Embedded 2005 Series, a mid-range processor family also based on the &#8220;Zen 5&#8221; architecture and designed for space-constrained networking, storage, and industrial edge applications. The new SoCs feature up to 16 cores (32 threads) with 64 MB L3 cache, support dual-channel DDR5-5600 memory with ECC, and offer 28 lanes of PCIe Gen5 connectivity. It also supports advanced RAS capabilities, BMC, PCIe Hot Plug, multi-SPI ROM, and AMD Infinity Guard security. The processors come in a compact 40 x 40mm BGA package, which, according to AMD, is up to 2.4x smaller than competing enterprise solutions (Intel Xeon 6500P-B).

<p>FlashESP is a web-based tool allowing the development of Arduino sketches and firmware flashing for ESP32 and ESP8266 hardware platforms. I initially thought it was similar to ESP Web Tools for flashing firmware from the web and used by projects like ESPHome, but it goes further than that, and it looks like an Arduino Cloud Editor for ESP32/ESP8266 instead, since users can select boards, write code, load libraries, and flash the resulting firmware from a compatible web browser without installing anything else on their computer. FlashESP key features: Cloud Compilation &#8211; Real-time compilation with live logs. Auto Configuration &#8211; Intelligent board and library detection. One-Click Flash &#8211; Web Serial integration. Connect your ESP via USB and flash directly from a compatible browser (WebSerial support needed) without any drivers or downloads.

<p>Nordic has introduced the nRF7002 EBII as an updated Wi-Fi 6 expansion board for its nRF54L series development kits. The earlier nRF7002 WiFi 6 board was a low-cost add-on for the Thingy:53, mainly for basic prototyping. The new EBII is designed for the newer nRF54L series of SoCs with dual-band Wi-Fi 6 support, power-profiling options, and more. Built around the nRF7002 Wi-Fi Companion IC, it supports Wi-Fi 6 features such as TWT, OFDMA, and BSS coloring for power efficiency and reduced interference. The EBII communicates with nRF54L15 and nRF54LM20 DKs through SPI/QSPI host interfaces, and includes headers for power profiling. Additionally, it features an onboard chip antenna, supports both STA and SoftAP modes, and maintains backward compatibility with 802.11a/b/g/n/ac. These features make it suitable for low-power multiprotocol IoT devices in smart homes, Matter, industrial sensing, wearables, and connected health applications. nRF7002 Expansion Board II specifications: Wi-Fi Companion IC – Nordic nRF7002 [...]</p>

<p>Anyone who has designed a custom ESP32 board or an RK3588 carrier knows the real bottleneck isn’t creativity — it’s the grunt work. Finding components that are actually in stock, checking pin compatibility, verifying footprints, building symbols, and dealing with yet another “NRND” surprise. It slows down even simple projects. A Multi-Agent System Built for Hardware Workflows YumiAI is a multi-agent engineering stack with the following features: Function Definition Agent: interprets requirements (“STM32WL LoRaWAN node, USB-C power”) and structures them into a proper engineering spec. Component Selection Agent: pulls real-time availability and pricing from DigiKey, Mouser, and LCSC. PCB Schematic Agent: generate circuit schematics using factory rules from a decade of manufacturing data to avoid unbuildable designs. The Killer Feature Today: Idea Validation While the schematic/PCB engine is still in active testing — and complex designs will require manual review — the market and business layers are already production-ready.

<p>Developed by Hungary-based AQEX, qUPS-P-BC-2.0 is a Raspberry Pi-compatible UPS HAT that supports multi-chemistry batteries, including Li-Ion, LiFePO₄, Sodium-Ion, and even supports large, high-capacity packs up to 300Ah. It is designed for applications that require long backup times and reliable 5V power. It features an offline UPS-like architecture with a highly efficient boost converter, adjustable input voltage and energy thresholds, as well as AUTO/ON/OFF operating modes to prevent reboot loops or unsafe restarts. Communication with the Raspberry Pi is handled through three GPIO pins to provide alerts for power loss and low battery. The board supports up to 7.5A discharge, 2A charging, USB-C and auxiliary 6–28V input, reverse-polarity and thermal protection, and external power-control capability. It’s also stackable with other HATs thanks to a robust soldered 40-pin header.

<p>Olimex ESP32-C6-DevKit-Lipo board is a small open-source hardware board based on the ESP32-C6 WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.0 LE, and Zigbee/Thread SoC with support for LiPo batteries and UEXT expansion modules. It&#8217;s the second announcement from the company this week, and comes after they introduced the MOD-ESP32-C5 to add wireless connectivity to boards equipped with a UEXT connector. The ESP32-C6-DevKit-Lipo adds to the list of small ESP32-C6 USB-C boards, such as the 01Space ESP32-C6 board and Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6, among many others. It&#8217;s actually larger than most similar boards, but differentiates itself with its open-hardware design, dual USB-C design, breadboard compatibility, LiPo battery circuitry, and a UEXT connector.

<p>When 3D printing, users will always waste filament one way or the other, either due to a failed print or because of the support for the print, and there may also be test/old prints that you don&#8217;t need/use anymore, for example, a retraction cube or a benchy. That means all that material usually ends up in the dustbin. Priyank Pal, founder of Creative3dp, did not like all that waste, so he created the ExtrudeX machine to recycle 3D print waste and filament scraps back into usable filament. On top of that, the machine itself is 3D printable and much more affordable than commercial solutions from companies such as Filabot. I&#8217;d usually provide the specifications here, but as a crowdfunded project, the ExtrudeX&#8217;s full technical details are not fully available. We just know that a single DC gear motor drives the main screw inside a metal barrel, while band heaters and [...]</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Out of the box, if you buy a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5, install it on the official CM5 IO Board, and install a fan on it (e.g. my current favorite, the <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/edatec/ED-CM5ACOOLER/25696857">EDAtec CM5 Active Cooler</a>), you'll notice the fan ramps up to 100% speed after you shut down the Pi.</p>

<p>That's not fun, since at least for a couple of my CM5s, they are more often powered down than running, creating a slight cacophany!</p></div>

<p>We finally have Intel Arc GPUs working on the Pi <em>somewhat</em> stably—it required overcoming many small hurdles, but it looks like support could land in Raspberry Pi OS if we can get <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250715061837.2144388-1-zhangzhijie@bosc.ac.cn/">a simple patch upstreamed</a><sup id="patchnote"><a href="#fn:patchnote" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
