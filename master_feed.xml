<p>We&#8217;ve already seen some small HDMI displays, mostly useful for SBCs like Raspberry Pi boards, including a 7-inch monitor with a stand, a 7-inch HDMI touchscreen display, and a 7.9-inch ultrawide HDMI display. Today, I&#8217;ve come across another form factor with two 4-inch square HDMI touchscreen displays with 720&#215;720 resolution: the VIEWE model appears to be new and is the cheaper of the two at about $33, while the Waveshare &#8220;4inch HDMI LCD (C)&#8221; has been around for a couple of years and offers extra features such as a 3.5 mm audio jack and speakers support, and mounting for Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 single board computers with adapters.

<p>When it comes to ESP32-based WLED controllers, some of the best options are boards like the Adafruit Sparkle Motion, Mini Sparkle Motion, and Sparkle Motion Stick, but most of the time, they are out of stock. Thankfully, there are similar alternatives like the xChroma WLED Type-C and HACK Lab HackLED Pro, with similar features and wider availability. Now adding to that list is the 2-Port ESP32 ETH0 WLED Controller, which not only adds Ethernet connectivity but also supports dual outputs and 5V–24V LEDs, making it an excellent alternative to the Adafruit ones. The board supports both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connectivity and includes an onboard DC-DC converter that delivers a stable 5V supply to the ESP32 and logic circuits. Each output channel is fused with a 6A resettable polyfuse and a status LED that lights up during fault conditions. For added safety, the main power input is protected against reverse polarity, [...]</p>

<p>We’re going to do a quick review of smart outdoor motorised shades from Weffort — another brand that makes smart shades compatible with popular Smart Home platforms, including Home Assistant, SmartThings, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Amazon Alexa. The cool thing about Weffort’s shades is that everything’s fully customisable and made-to-order — from the fabric and motors to casing styles, size, and the Smart Home platform you want to use with. With various options, it might sound complicated at first (usually people just let a pro handle it), but it’s actually way easier than you think. Plus, the shades are lightweight, so you can totally install them by yourself. Custom-made shades Before we got the test unit from Weffort, they let us locate a good spot for installation and testing so that we could take measurements following the guide on their website, which also has tips on choosing materials, installation, measurements, [...]</p>

<p>upyOS is a modular, lightweight MicroPython-based operating system (OS) that provides a Unix-like experience on low-resource microcontrollers such as Espressif Systems ESP32/ESP32-C3/ESP32-S3, Raspberry Pi RP2040, and others. Inspired by smolOS, upyOS offers remote development tools, OTA updates, and a built-in web server. Its modular architecture separates system functions into reusable components, instead of large, monolithic programs. Key Features: Modular architecture: Commands and system functionality are broken down into small, independent modules to reduce memory usage. Built-in shell environment: Execute commands and scripts directly, providing a Unix-like CLI experience. Startup and shutdown scripting: Configure boot and shutdown behaviors using /etc/init.sh and /etc/end.sh. Recovery mode: A built-in failsafe mechanism lets users recover the system when booting fails. Background execution: Supports threads and asyncio for background tasks, along with &#38; sufix, hold, resume, kill and killall commands for process control. Remote development support: Telnet and FTP servers allow file transfer and terminal access over [...]</p>

<p>Qualcomm has just signed an agreement to acquire Arduino, and the goal of the purchase is to &#8220;combine Qualcomm’s leading-edge products and technologies with Arduino’s vast ecosystem and community to empower businesses, students, entrepreneurs, tech professionals, educators, and enthusiasts to quickly and easily bring ideas to life.&#8221; They also took the opportunity to launch the Arduino UNO Q &#8220;dual-brain&#8221; SBC powered by a Qualcomm DragonWing QRB2210 SoC running Linux and an STMicro STM32U585 MCU for real-time control, as well as the Arduino App Lab integrated development environment to &#8220;unify the Arduino journey across Real‑time OS, Linux, Python, and AI flows&#8221;. Will the acquisition change anything? I suppose we&#8217;ll see more and more Arduino boards based on Qualcomm processors, but the company also promises to preserve Arduino&#8217;s open approach and community: Arduino will retain its independent brand, tools, and mission, while continuing to support a wide range of microcontrollers and microprocessors [...]</p>

<p>wafer.space has launched its first pooled silicon fabrication run on Crowd Supply, called the GF180MCU Run 1, which enables designers, engineers, and companies to create 1,000 custom ASICs using GlobalFoundries’ 180 nm mixed-signal process.  Each slot provides a fixed 3.88 × 5.07 mm (19.67 mm²) die area replicated 1,000 times, meaning you will receive 1000 chips, with options for bare dies or chip-on-board packaging. The GF180MCU process supports 5 metal layers, MIM capacitors (~2.0 fF/µm²), poly and high-res poly resistors, and standard-Vt MOS devices. Users can handle their own pad ring, ESD, and I/O layout while wafer.space manages fabrication, dicing, and shipping from Singapore. Designs can be open or closed source, and full wafers are also available for advanced testing or collection. Designs are submitted to wafer.space as GDSII files (the standard file format for chip layouts). Wafer.space automatically checks these files to make sure they can be manufactured correctly.

<p>Since Debian 13 &#8220;Trixie&#8221; was released last August, it was just a matter of time until Raspberry Pi OS followed. Raspberry Pi announced the update from Bookworm to Trixie a few days ago. The new Raspberry Pi OS images get the new and updated packages from Debian 13, and features like 64-bit time support to solve the Y2K38 bug. However, as Simon Long, UX engineer at Raspberry Pi, points out, there have been fewer changes in newer versions of Debian, and most changes in the new version of Pi OS are cosmetic, although there are some interesting under-the-hood changes as well. The most obvious change from the user&#8217;s perspective is the new theme featuring a completely new set of icons, a new font (Nunito Sans Light), new desktop backgrounds (the new default is a photo of the sun rising over the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho), and some other small tweaks.

<p>The price of DDR4 memory has increased dramatically in recent months due to limited supply and increased demand for AI workloads. The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and 5 (CM4/CM5) are based on LPDDR4 memory, and Raspberry Pi reports that memory costs are roughly 120% higher than they were just a year ago. So they have no choice but to increase the price by $5 to $10 for the CM4 and CM5, as well as the Raspberry Pi 500 keyboard PC. I assume the $200 price tag for the Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keyboard PC released last week already includes this new reality. Product affected: 4GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $5 8GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $10 Raspberry Pi 500 unit-only increases by $10 to $100 Raspberry Pi Development Kit for Compute Module 5 increases by $5 to [...]</p>

<p>Linux 6.17 has just been released on LKML: No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go. Below is the shortlog for just the last week &#8211; not the full 6.17 release &#8211; as usual. It&#8217;s not exciting, which is all good. I think the biggest patch in there is some locking fixes for some bluetooth races that could cause use-after-free situations. Whee &#8211; that&#8217;s about as exciting as it gets. Other than that, there&#8217; the usual driver fixlets (GPU and networking dominate as usual, but &#8220;dominate&#8221; is still pretty small), there&#8217;s some minor random other driver updates, some filesystem noise, and core kernel and mm. And some selftest updates. This obviously means that the merge window for 6.18 will open tomorrow, and I already have four dozen pull requests pending. Thanks to the proactive people &#8211; you know who [...]</p>

<p>LUNYEE has sent us a review sample of the 4040 PRO CNC router, featuring a larger work volume than the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra model we reviewed a few months ago. It is designed for milling and engraving tasks that demand high precision and features a robust structure to support continuous operation. It works with wood, plastic, and acrylic. Its standout feature is the complete set of accessories, such as the Probe system for Z-axis setup and a workpiece clamping kit, allowing users to get started right away. This makes it an ideal CNC Router for beginners in engraving work. We&#8217;ve previously reviewed the smaller 3018 Pro Ultra with Easel, but we&#8217;ll instead use Candle software on the 4040 PRO machine.

<p>Fing has recently introduced the &#8220;Fing Agent Raspberry Pi Kit&#8220;, also called &#8220;Fing Agent plug-and-play Raspberry Pi 4 kit&#8221;, for its Fing Agent network monitoring system, which can be considered a follow-up to the earlier Fingbox hardware released in 2017. While Fingbox was a custom appliance based on Ubuntu Core, the new kit uses a Raspberry Pi, making it easier to set up and use in a home or small office network. The kit includes a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB) in an aluminium case, a 32GB microSD card with Fing Agent preinstalled, a USB-C power supply with adapters, and a Cat 5e Ethernet cable. Once connected to the router, it works with the Fing app, desktop, or web to monitor devices, track uptime and speed, detect intrusions, and send alerts about unusual activity. It also supports device blocking, presence detection, and diagnostics, such as port scans and vulnerability checks. Making it [...]</p>
