<p>Huawei Matebook Pro (HAD-W24 / HAD-W32) resembles a typical laptop with a 14.2-inch display, 24GB to 32GB RAM, and 1TB or 2TB SSD storage. What&#8217;s less common is that the processor is not named, and the laptop is the first to run Huawei&#8217;s HarmonyOS operating system. Those two are due to Western countries&#8217; sanctions against the Chinese company. Huawei used to sell Intel-based laptops with Windows and Android smartphones, but they&#8217;ve not made hardware based on US technology for a while. As software support would eventually run out, they had to work on an alternative named HarmonyOS, which has been used on smartwatches, smartphones, and tablets for a while, but the Matebook Pro is the first computer sold with the new OS. While we don&#8217;t know the processor used, reports mention the Kirin X90 10-core (4+4+2) / 20-thread Arm SoC as an &#8220;Apple Silicon&#8221; solution.

<p>In the first part of the review, we checked out the hardware of the M5Stack Tab5 ESP32-P4 IoT development kit and tried the demo firmware, whose user interface allows the user to quickly experiment with the camera, microphone, speaker, WiFi, power consumption, GPIOs, RS485, and more. Since there&#8217;s no user application for the Tab5 at this stage, I decided to look into software development resources for the ESP32-P4 devkit in the second part of the review.

<p>We all know that Arm Cortex-A are application cores, Cortex-M microcontroller-class cores, and Cortex-R real-time cores used in various applications from IoT to automotive or architecture. But this may soon be thrown out of the window, as Rene Haas, Arm CEO, has published a short post entitled &#8220;The Arm Evolution: From IP to Platform for the AI Era&#8221; introducing a new product naming architecture with five categories: Arm Neoverse for infrastructure Arm Niva for PC Arm Lumex for mobile Arm Zena for automotive Arm Orbis for IoT While it&#8217;s not explicitly stated in the post, I assume that means the Cortex naming goes away because we&#8217;re told the Mali brand will continue as the GPU brand, and the Arm Neoverse N1, based on Cortex-A76, is an example where Cortex branding is not used anymore. So I understand, they just decided to apply similar naming to all the product lines, although [...]</p>

<p>Recently, we received a custom-made-to-order smart shade from SmartWings for review. We never heard about SmartWings before, but the company claims to have been in the smart blind/shade and home automation industry for over 15 years. Their standout feature is the high degree of customisation they offer—whether it&#8217;s the type of shade, custom size up to almost 3 meters in width and height, various fabric styles, and compatibility with major Smart Home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, Samsung SmartThings, Home Assistant, and Hubitat. SmartWings asked us to select a location in the house where we wanted to review the smart shade. We wanted to review a solar-powered outdoor shade, so we selected a windowed door with direct sunlight. We carefully measured the dimensions following the instructions on the company&#8217;s website to understand the process. We had to select the shade type, privacy level of the fabric (openness), [...]</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just received a review sample of the M5Stack Tab5 ESP32-P4 IoT development kit, which looks like a small tablet with a 5-inch touchscreen display, a 2MP front-facing camera, an ESP32-C6 WiFi 6, Bluetooth, and 802.15.4 wireless module, and various expansion interfaces. Today, I&#8217;ll go through an unboxing, a (partial) teardown, and have a quick try with the default firmware and GUI, before checking out how to program the device in the second part of the review. M5Stack Tab5 unboxing I received the Tab5 in its retail package along with an M5Stack-branded transparent sticky tape roll. Not sure why, but thanks M5Stack, sticky tape is always useful, so appreciated! The bottom side of the package has all the key features and specifications that we already covered in our article about the Tab5. The package contains the Tab5 itself, a 2,000mAh/14.8Wh battery, and a cable with six wires for the ExtPort2 [...]</p>

<p>SiFli SF23LB52J is a Bluetooth 5.3 microcontroller part of the SF32LB52x family with two Cortex-M33 in big.LITTLE configuration with a 240 MHz high-performance core for user application/GUI and a 24 MHz low-power core to manage the Bluetooth part. A few months ago, Eric Migicovsky, the founder of the smartwatch company Pebble, and now Core Devices, introduced the Core 2 Duo and Core Time 2 smartwatches running PebbleOS open-source firmware that were mostly relaunches of the never-released Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 with some tweaks. We already knew the Core 2 Duo would be based on a Nordic nRF52840 Arm Cortex-M4F microcontroller, however, the one for the Core Time 2 was kept secret. That&#8217;s until today, as Eric has just announced that the Core Time 2 would be based on the SiFli SF23LB52J MCU, since the smartwatch required an MCU with more RAM and processing power, and SiFli also offers [...]</p>

<p>Michael Opdenacker, Founder of Root Commit, has published free and open-source training materials on OpenEmbedded and Yocto using the BeaglePlay SBC powered by a Texas Instruments AM625 processor. If the name rings a bell, it&#8217;s because Michael was the founder of Bootlin (previously Free Electrons) before selling the company to employees in 2021. He&#8217;s now started a new company called Root Commit, where he continues providing Embedded Linux training and development services. He&#8217;s kept the tradition of releasing free training materials, with the latest course being related to Yocto development on the BeaglePlay board. You&#8217;ll find resources on the Root Commit website with three files, including 220 pages of lectures, 18 practical labs for the BeaglePlay board and QEMU, and source code/patchsets released under a Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0 license.

<p>The PicoEMP is a compact, low-cost, open-source electromagnetic fault injector (EMFI) tool developed by Colin O&#8217;Flynn for researchers, hobbyists, and educators interested in hardware security. Unlike NewAE’s professional-grade ChipSHOUTER, PicoEMP is a bare-bones device designed to be safe, usable, and most importantly, affordable. Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico, this device generates high-voltage pulses using a transformer circuit (originally for photographic flash charging) to discharge energy from a low-ESR ceramic capacitor into a custom-made coil tip, which creates an electromagnetic field capable of injecting a little bit of power to the internals of the processors such as registers and SRAM. This can be exploited to flip bits and test the robustness of embedded systems against such attacks.
