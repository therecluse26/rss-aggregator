<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from cloud-first architectures to edge-first designs, so more processing now runs on phones, cameras, and embedded controllers. Running inference on-device cuts latency and keeps sensitive data local. This momentum is reshaping product roadmaps, all due to different revolutions driven by edge AI. The Core Revolutions Driven by Edge AI Instead of routing every model and signal to the cloud, devices are processing more data locally to act faster and protect sensitive information. Because edge AI is changing where intelligence runs, IDC estimates global spending on edge computing reached about $261 billion in 2025. This rapid enterprise investment is due to several reasons. 1. Enabling Real-Time, On-Device Decisions Eliminating the cloud round-trip lets devices turn sensor input into action in milliseconds. This capability is essential for industrial automation and control loops because embedded AI processors run optimized models on-device, so decisions happen continuously. 2. Strengthening Privacy [...]</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi CM0 is a yet-to-be-officially-announced castellated Compute Module based on the Raspberry Pi RP3A0 SiP (System-in-Package) found in the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3E (CM3E). Since most Raspberry Pi products are announced under a strict embargo, I&#8217;m always surprised when I find new Raspberry Pi hardware that was never formally introduced. But it seems to happen from time to time for products targeting business customers specifically. The CM3E Compute Module was one example, and the CM0 appears to be another. Raspberry Pi CM0 specifications: SiP – Raspberry Pi RP3A0 SoC &#8211; Broadcom BCM2710A1 CPU &#8211; Quad-core Cortex-A53 processor @ 1.0 GHz GPU &#8211; VideoCore IV GPU supporting OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0 graphics VPU &#8211; H.264/MPEG-4 1080p30 video decoding, H.264  1080p30 video encoding System Memory &#8211; 512MB LPDDR2 RAM Storage – 0GB (Raspberry Pi CM0 Lite), 8GB, or 16GB eMMC flash Wireless &#8211; Optional [...]</p>

<p>Compex Systems (Compex) is redefining how wireless is integrated into modern embedded and industrial systems with the launch of JustWiFi⁷™, a one-of-a-kind, driverless, tri-band concurrent Wi-Fi 7 module that connects through Ethernet protocols. Designed to eliminate the complexity of traditional wireless integration, JustWiFi⁷™ makes high-performance Wi-Fi deployment faster, simpler, and smarter. Rethinking Wi-Fi Integration: No Drivers. No Hassle. JustWiFi⁷™ Most of the Wi-Fi modules today rely on PCIe, SDIO, or USB interfaces and are controlled through drivers. Developers will need to deal with the drivers&#8217; compatibility with the host platform, particularly its OS and kernel version. The drivers for Wi-Fi 7 are particularly complex due to the standard&#8217;s advanced features.

<p>GL.iNet Comet PoE (GL-RM1PE) is a new KVM over IP solution featuring a quad-core Correx-A53 SoC, support for Power-over-Ethernet (PoE), a 32GB eMMC flash, and the usual HDMI and USB ports. It&#8217;s essentially an upgrade to the Comet PoE (GL-RM1) KVM over IP box equipped with PoE and a 32GB eMMC flash capable of handling larger ISO files. It also relies on the faster Cortex-A53 processor used in the upcoming Comet Pro, currently on Kickstarter, with WiFi 6, a 2.2-inch touchscreen display, and HDMI passthrough. GL.iNet also claims faster file transfer (35 MB/s read &#38; 25 MB/s write speeds) of about three times faster than the original Comet.

<p>People have been recycling batteries in disposable vapes for a while, but BogdanTheGeek has gone a lot of further, converting a specific model of disposable vape into a web server. How is that possible? Vapes have apparently become a bit more sophisticated in recent times, and some integrate an Arm Cortex microcontroller with a USB-C port that can be used to bring a network interface and run a web server. The specific disposable vape (exact model not provided, but Grok thinks it may be from Bang King. Update: Wrong!) used by BogdanTheGeek features one of the ultra-cheap Puya PY32 microcontrollers, namely a 24 MHz PY32F002B Cortex-M0+ MCU with 3 kB SRAM and 24 kB flash.

<p>RAKwireless &#8220;RAK3112 WisDuo Module for Edge AI with LoRa&#8221; combines an ESP32-S3 WiFi and BLE SoC with a Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver for Edge AI applications and Meshtastic user interfaces. The 3-in-1 LoRa + WiFi  + BLE module is an update to the ESP32-based RAK11200 WisDuo LoRa module, which has limitations in terms of computing power and memory. Those became apparent in more demanding applications such as Edge AI or complex mesh networks. With 16MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM and a more powerful ESP32-S3 microcontroller, the RAK3112 WisDuo module overcomes those limitations for camera and audio processing, as well as mesh networks like Meshtastic. It also offers a more powerful alternative to the pin-compatible RAK11160 STM32 + ESP32-C2 module that&#8217;s better suited for battery-powered sensors.

<p>SeeedStudio sent us a tiny Smart IR Remote hub for review: XIAO Smart IR Mate, or XIAO IR Mate for short. At first glance, it looks like any other WiFi IR blasters, but what makes it interesting is that the device is built on an open architecture using the XIAO ESP32C3 module and runs on ESPHome, working natively with the Home Assistant open-source home automation platform. As usual, SeeedStudio gives access to the source code, so it’s super convenient if you want to tweak the functions yourself to fit various needs. For those who are new to Smart IR, it&#8217;s a device that acts as an infrared (IR) control hub. The idea is to let you control legacy IR-based devices (old TVs, air conditioners, stereos, etc.) via a Smart Home system. We did several tests with several devices we had lying around, namely a Hatari oscillating fan, a Dyson blade-less [...]</p>

<p>We often write about breadboard-friendly boards, which typically means they plug nicely into a breadboard, but usually leave only one or two rows to play with on each side. So far, the best option we have come across is probably the Raspberry Breadstick, which is designed for full-length breadboards, but is limited by the I/Os on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU. When it comes to breadboard friendliness, it&#8217;s hard to beat The Pi Hut&#8217;s Baguette S3, as it provides a single 30-pin header designed to be inserted in one of the rows of a breadboard, leaving plenty of space for prototyping. The board also features an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, a microSD card slot, a USB-C for power and programming, a Qwiic port for further expansion, an RGB LED, and RESET and BOOT buttons.

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>
