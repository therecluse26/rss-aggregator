<p>Spiffing Brit argued it's a mix of YouTube's seasonality (it's back to school season) and channels falling off, or as TechLinked puts it, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ5pATTvc2o">git gud</a>", while Josh Strife Hayes points out the massive number of channels which identified a <em>historic</em> shift down in desktop views (compared to mobile, tablet, and TV) starting after August 10.

<p>People have been recycling batteries in disposable vapes for a while, but BogdanTheGeek has gone a lot of further, converting a specific model of disposable vape into a web server. How is that possible? Vapes have apparently become a bit more sophisticated in recent times, and some integrate an Arm Cortex microcontroller with a USB-C port that can be used to bring a network interface and run a web server. The specific disposable vape (exact model not provided, but Grok thinks it may be from Bang King. Update: Wrong!) used by BogdanTheGeek features one of the ultra-cheap Puya PY32 microcontrollers, namely a 24 MHz PY32F002B Cortex-M0+ MCU with 3 kB SRAM and 24 kB flash.

<p>RAKwireless &#8220;RAK3112 WisDuo Module for Edge AI with LoRa&#8221; combines an ESP32-S3 WiFi and BLE SoC with a Semtech SX1262 LoRa transceiver for Edge AI applications and Meshtastic user interfaces. The 3-in-1 LoRa + WiFi  + BLE module is an update to the ESP32-based RAK11200 WisDuo LoRa module, which has limitations in terms of computing power and memory. Those became apparent in more demanding applications such as Edge AI or complex mesh networks. With 16MB of flash and 8MB of PSRAM and a more powerful ESP32-S3 microcontroller, the RAK3112 WisDuo module overcomes those limitations for camera and audio processing, as well as mesh networks like Meshtastic. It also offers a more powerful alternative to the pin-compatible RAK11160 STM32 + ESP32-C2 module that&#8217;s better suited for battery-powered sensors.

<p>SeeedStudio sent us a tiny Smart IR Remote hub for review: XIAO Smart IR Mate, or XIAO IR Mate for short. At first glance, it looks like any other WiFi IR blasters, but what makes it interesting is that the device is built on an open architecture using the XIAO ESP32C3 module and runs on ESPHome, working natively with the Home Assistant open-source home automation platform. As usual, SeeedStudio gives access to the source code, so it’s super convenient if you want to tweak the functions yourself to fit various needs. For those who are new to Smart IR, it&#8217;s a device that acts as an infrared (IR) control hub. The idea is to let you control legacy IR-based devices (old TVs, air conditioners, stereos, etc.) via a Smart Home system. We did several tests with several devices we had lying around, namely a Hatari oscillating fan, a Dyson blade-less [...]</p>

<p>We often write about breadboard-friendly boards, which typically means they plug nicely into a breadboard, but usually leave only one or two rows to play with on each side. So far, the best option we have come across is probably the Raspberry Breadstick, which is designed for full-length breadboards, but is limited by the I/Os on the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU. When it comes to breadboard friendliness, it&#8217;s hard to beat The Pi Hut&#8217;s Baguette S3, as it provides a single 30-pin header designed to be inserted in one of the rows of a breadboard, leaving plenty of space for prototyping. The board also features an ESP32-S3 microcontroller, a microSD card slot, a USB-C for power and programming, a Qwiic port for further expansion, an RGB LED, and RESET and BOOT buttons.

<p>Formuler Z12 Ultra is an Android 12 4K TV box powered by a Realtek RTD1319C SoC coupled with 4GB RAM and 128GB eMMC flash, support for Dolby Vision and Atmos, and popular USB ATSC or DVB-T/T2 digital TV tuners. While it was first seen in 2022 on the Formuler Z11 Pro Max, the RTD1319C is new to me, and it appears to be a variant of the RTD1319 quad-core Cortex-A55 SoC introduced in 2020, which replaces an entry-level Mali-G31 MP2 with an older, mid-range Mali-G57 MC1 GPU that should allow for smoother or higher-resolution user interfaces. However, it lacks the 4Kp60 H.266/VVC video codec support found in the Realtek RTD1319D.

<p>We&#8217;ve already checked out the specifications, gone through an unboxing and a teardown, and booted the Beelink EQi13 Pro mini PC to Windows 11 Pro in the first part of the review. Since then, we&#8217;ve had more time to test the Intel Core i5-13500H 12-core/16-thread Raptor Lake mini PC with Windows 11 Pro in detail. So we&#8217;ll now report our experience with features testing, benchmarks, Ethernet and WiFi performance evaluation, 4K and 8K YouTube video playback, and measurements of fan noise and power consumption for the Beelink EQi13 Pro mid-range mini PC.

<p>Realtek introduced the RTL8127 10GbE to PCIe NIC at Computex 2025 last May as a low-power, low-cost 10Gbps Ethernet solution for PCIe and M.2 networking cards with an estimated price of around $30 to $40. The good news is that 10GbE PCIe and M.2 cards are now available for sale, just not always at the expected price points. Let&#8217;s have a look at some of the options available.

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>

<p>Libre Computer has just announced the general availability of EtherealOS for the company&#8217;s Amlogic SBCs, namely AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato), AML-S805X-AC (La Frite), AML-S905X-CC-V2 ( Sweet Potato), AML-S905D3-CC (Solitude), and AML-A311D-CC (Alta). EtherealOS is described as a lightweight internet-booted operating system designed for performing tasks such as file and disk manipulation, operating system deployment, light browser tasks, and more. It includes a limited set of tools compared to a full operating system, and it&#8217;s basically an OS to install other operating systems directly from the Internet, in a way similar to Khadas OOWOW or Radxa ROOBI OS. The difference is that EtherealOS apparently supports upstreamed operating systems, namely Debian (debian-12.11.0-arm64-DVD-1.iso / debian-testing-arm64-DVD-1.iso), Fedora (Fedora-Workstation-Live-42-1.1.aarch64.iso), and OpenSUSE, besides images optimized by Libre Computer based on Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspbian.

<p>TerraMaster has sent me the D1 SSD Plus portable SSD enclosure for review, and helped me get a 2TB WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD for testing, since the PCIe Gen4 x4 storage device reached up 7,300 MB/s to sequential read speeds, and 6,600 MB/s sequential write speeds, well beyond the 40Gbps capabilities of the enclosure. I had reviewed two ORICO NVMe enclosures previously, namely the ORICO COM2-T3 and ORICO M234C3-U4, which were both based on an Intel JH7440 Thunderbolt 3 chip. I tested the COM2-T3 up to 3166.71 MB/s with a fast SSD, but TerraMaster claims up to 3,853MB/s sequential read speed and 3,707 MB/s sequential write speed with a 4TB Samsung 990 PRO SSD, while connected to an Apple M4 Pro Mac mini (MacOS version 15.3.2) using AJA System Test software.

<p>LWMalloc is an ultra-lightweight dynamic memory allocator designed for embedded systems that is said to outperform ptmalloc used in Glibc, achieving up to 53% faster execution time and 23% lower memory usage. Malloc can cause memory fragmentation on embedded systems, potentially leading to crashes after the firmware runs long enough. Garbage collection is one technique for lowering fragmentation, but it&#8217;s not always practical on resource-constrained devices, and some simply avoid using malloc in their firmware, preferring static memory allocation or memory pools to improve reliability. Custom dynamic memory allocators are another option, and that&#8217;s what LWMalloc provides. LWMalloc is described in a paper entitled &#8220;LWMalloc: A Lightweight Dynamic Memory Allocator for Resource-Constrained Environments&#8221; as follows: LWMalloc incorporates a lightweight data structure, a deferred coalescing (DC) policy, and dedicated small chunk pools to optimize memory allocation. The lightweight data structure minimizes metadata overhead, ensuring a compact and efficient implementation. The DC [...]</p>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

<p>This Classic was handed to me alongside my Uncle Mark's Apple II, which I'll probably cover later (we've played a game of whack-a-mole with issues on that machine! Well worth it but I haven't hit a point where enough things are working to cover it well, heh).</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>
