<p>Ariel OS is a new RTOS for microcontrollers written in Rust with support for popular hardware architectures (Arm Cortex-M, ESP32, RISC-V) and boards from Espressif, Nordic Semi, Raspberry Pi, and STMicroelectronics. Ariel OS is built on top of Embassy Rust framework and embedded-hal Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for embedded systems, and adds several OS functionalities and a multi-core capable scheduler. It is mainly designed for secure, memory-safe, networked applications on microcontrollers. The developers further describe Ariel OS as follows on the project&#8217;s website: Ariel OS follows an approach whereby it simultaneously integrates a curated ecosystem of libraries (available via crates.io), and adds missing operating system functionalities as depicted below.

<p>Infineon has introduced the AIROC ACW741x tri-radio Wi-Fi 7 wireless SoC family designed for IoT and smart home devices. The company mentions it&#8217;s the first Wi-Fi 7 solution with a &#8220;20 MHz&#8221; 1&#215;1 Wi-Fi 7 radio, Bluetooth 6.0 (including Channel Sounding), and an 802.15.4 radio for Thread and Matter support, in a 7&#215;7 mm QFN package. When we think of Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be), we usually picture high-end routers and smartphones with gigabits of data over the huge 320 MHz channels. But the standard also includes features specifically designed for low-power IoT devices. Infineon&#8217;s new AIROC ACW741x family, which they claim is the &#8220;industry’s first&#8221; Wi-Fi 7 SoC specifically optimized for IoT applications, including smart home, battery-powered sensors, access control systems, asset tracking, video doorbells, IP cameras, smart locks, thermostats, and other always-connected devices requiring secure, low-power wireless connectivity.

<p>We&#8217;ve seen people try to make MCU development boards as breadboard-friendly as possible by leaving plenty of space to connect wires and components. lhm0 tackled the issue from the opposite direction and designed 3D printed breadboards optimized for Raspberry Pi Pico and ESP32 development boards. The Pico typically only leaves two rows of each side of a typical breadboard, and some ESP32 boards are wide enough to take all rows and, as a result, are unusable. The trick here was to design the breadboard for each board with an opening in the middle, so that they only take two rows (one on each side) on the 3D printed breadboard, and the user still has four rows on each side to play with, plus the top and bottom rows. We only have photos for two variants of the breadboard (highlighted in bold below), but a total of five breadboard designs are [...]</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi OS Trixie now supports USB gadget mode out of the box, allowing users to connect to their Raspberry Pi boards over IP through USB without the need for a router. My first experience with USB gadget functionality was when I reviewed the Beaglebone Green Wireless SBC in 2016, but for some reason, official support for the Raspberry Pi ecosystem took a lot longer, and it was only officially implemented in Raspberry Pi OS Trixie images dated 20.10.2025 and later through the rpi-usb-gadget package. It&#8217;s been possible to use the USB gadget mode on Raspberry Pi OS for a while, but it was rather convoluted with outdated scripts, manual configuration steps, and platform-specific instructions. The new rpi-usb-gadget package streamlines the process and makes things much easier: The Raspberry Pi SBC will present itself as a USB Ethernet device when connected to a PC Users can SSH directly using the [...]</p>

<p>Advantech MIO-5355 is a 3.5-inch SBC based on Qualcomm QCS6490 or QCS5430 Edge AI processor. The board features up to 8GB of LPDDR5 memory, 128GB of UFS storage, and supports various operating systems, including Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, and Yocto Linux.

<p>Last year, Geehy introduced the industry’s first dual-core Cortex-M52 real-time MCU, and has now followed up with the G32R430, an Arm Cortex-M52 Encoder MCU with two 16-bit ADCs and a hardware ATAN (arctangent) accelerator for sub-1 µs electrical angle computation in high-precision encoder and motion control systems. The MCU is clocked at 128 MHz and uses ITCM/DTCM tightly coupled memory for deterministic, zero-wait-state execution, alongside a 4KB cache for low-latency control loops. It integrates two 16-bit high-precision ADCs with support for synchronous sampling, along with an extra 12-bit ADC, multiple analog comparators, DACs, and an on-chip temperature sensor, allowing encoder designs to be built with very few external analog components. It also supports various encoder protocols, including BiSS-C, SSI, Tamagawa, and SPI, and includes generic interfaces like USART, SPI, and I²C. With a –40°C to +105°C industrial operating range, this MCU is suitable for servo motors, industrial robots, absolute and incremental [...]</p>

<p>ESPHome 2026.1.0 open-source firmware has just been released with new features like automatic WiFi roaming and Zigbee support for Nordic Semi nRF52 targets, as well as memory optimization for ESP32/ESP8266 hardware, among many other changes. Other notable changes include security updates with the project replacing API password authentication with API encryption and requiring SHA256 authentication for OTA updates, better support for non-ASCII configuration, and updates to LibreTiny platforms (BK72xx, RTL87xx, LN882x), which received thread-safe WiFi, atomics, and deep sleep support. ESPHome developers used to advise users not to use ESP8266, not because it was not suitable for the task, but because the runtime heap on ESP8266 routinely dropped below 10k, and devices were unreliable. Since millions of ESP8266 devices were already deployed in homes, they decided to do something about it. The project was greatly helped thanks to increased support from the Open Home Foundation, which allows the project to [...]</p>

<p>Developed by Laboratorium in Poland, the M5MonsterC5 is an ESP32-C5-based &#8220;Marauder&#8221; hacking tool designed to work with M5Stack Cardputer ADV or M5Stack Tab5. It gets connected to the Cardputer ADV or Tab5 via a Grove connector and runs JanOS and Project Zero for wireless security research, experimentation, and rapid prototyping with minimal setup. Built around the ESP32-C5, the device supports dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (2.4/5-GHz) and 802.15.4 (Thread/Zigbee) to the M5Stack devices. Key features include multi-channel deauthentication with 5 GHz support, Evil Twin and phishing captive portals, WPA3 SAE overflow attacks, wardriving with GPS logging and WiGLE-compatible exports, passive sniffing, Karma attacks, whitelist management, and persistent “blackout” modes. The platform uses a two-stage web-based flashing process (JanOS on the Monster board and a Cardputer app flasher), offers microSD card and optional GPS support, and is intended strictly for authorized Wi-Fi auditing, offensive security research, and educational use under the Project Zero [...]</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi sent me a sample of their AI HAT+ 2 generative AI accelerator based on Hailo-10H for review. The 40 TOPS AI accelerator is advertised as being suitable for LLMs (Large Language Models) and VLM (Vision Language Models), while delivering about the same performance as the first-generation AI HAT+ (Hailo-8) for AI vision/computer vision models. After going through an unboxing, I&#8217;ll assemble the AI HAT+ 2 to a Raspberry Pi 5 with 2GB of RAM fitted with a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, before quickly checking whether AI vision models work as expected, and spending more time on testing LLM and VLM samples. Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ 2 unboxing My sample had a somewhat long and rough trip from the UK to Thailand, and the package did not look that good when DHL delivered it. But luckily, nothing was damaged, and I got the AI HAT+ 2 with a [...]</p>

<p>This is a GPS-based clock running on a Raspberry Pi Pico in a custom 1U 10&quot; rack faceplate. The clock displays time based on a GPS input, and will not display time until a GPS timing lock has been acquired.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you turn on the Pico, the display reads <code>----</code></li>
<li>Upon 3D fix, you get a time on the clock, and the colon starts blinking</li>
<li>If the 3D fix is lost, the colon goes solid</li>
<li>When the 3D fix is regained, the colon starts blinking again</li>
</ul>

<p>Ever since I got <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/using-amd-gpus-on-raspberry-pi-without-recompiling-linux">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/all-intel-gpus-run-on-raspberry-pi-and-risc-v">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia</a> graphics cards to run on a Raspberry Pi, I had a nagging question:</p>
<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s. Not a fair fight.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:04:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Last week in AWS re:Invent with Corey Quinn</title><link>https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/12/19/last-week-in-aws-re-invent-with-corey-quinn/</link><description><![CDATA[Ryan sits down with Corey Quinn, Chief Cloud Economist at Duckbill, at AWS re:Invent to get Corey’s patented snarky take on all the happenings from the conference.]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 08:40:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>1.5 TB of VRAM on Mac Studio - RDMA over Thunderbolt 5</title><link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5/</link><description><![CDATA[<figure class="insert-image"><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5/mac-studio-cluster-1-hero.jpg"

The easiest way to test it is with <a href="https://exolabs.net">Exo 1.0</a>, an open source private AI clustering tool. RDMA lets the Macs all act like they have one giant pool of RAM, which speeds up things like massive AI models.</p>
<p>The stack of Macs I tested, with 1.5 TB of unified memory, costs just shy of $40,000, and if you're wondering, no I cannot justify spending that much money for this.
