Even with lower core counts and fewer memory channels, the modern EPYC 4005 "Grado" processors were able to outpace that original EPYC "Naples" flagship processor from 2017. With carrying out the fresh re-testing of the AMD EPYC 7601 on a modern 2025 Linux software stack, in today's article is a look at how the EPYC 7601 Zen 1 performance compares to the EPYC 9005 "Turin" series with today's flagship EPYC 9755 and EPYC 9965 processors.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 9 Jul 2025 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Red Hat Announces No-Cost RHEL For Business Developers</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Red-Hat-RHEL-Business-Devs</link><description><![CDATA[Red Hat this morning went public with RHEL for Business Developers, an expansion of their RHEL Developer Program to make it easier for business developers to make use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux at no-cost for their development efforts...]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 9 Jul 2025 14:06:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Crunching The News For Fun And Little Profit</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/07/09/crunching-the-news-for-fun-and-little-profit/</link><description><![CDATA[<div><img width="800" height="484" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?w=800" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-bottom: 15px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg 3000w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?resize=250,151 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?resize=400,242 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?resize=800,484 800w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?resize=1536,929 1536w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?resize=2048,1239 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-attachment-id="791295" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2025/07/09/crunching-the-news-for-fun-and-little-profit/crunching/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg" data-orig-size="3000,1815" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Crunching" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Crunching.jpg?w=800" /></div>Do you ever look at the news, and wonder about the process behind the news cycle?

<p>MayQueen Technologies PANZER-LITE93 is an NXP i.MX 93-powered box PC running a customized Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distribution with LXQt desktop environment and NPU libraries to leverage the built-in Arm Ethos-U65 micro NPU. The board itself is not actually anything new, and the company has been quite transparent about it, telling us by email that we&#8217;d &#8220;immediately recognize that it’s based on the FRDM-IMX93&#8221; development board.

<p>The 4-Ch PCIe FFC Adapter Board expands the PCIe interface of the Raspberry Pi 5 to four PCIe FFC connectors using the ASM1184e PCI Express packet switch chip, which we&#8217;ve seen in HATs like the Geekworm X1011 board, adding four NVMe SSDs, and the Waveshare PCIe-Packet-Switch-4P, adding four PCIe x1 slots. The HAT supports PCIe Gen2 speeds and features onboard power monitoring to track power consumption. There is also an EEPROM for storing configuration data, and the option to stack multiple PCIe HATs. Additionally, users can install a heatsink on the HAT to manage thermal performance, making it well-suited for embedded solutions that require multiple PCIe devices. Waveshare PCIe TO 4-CH HAT specifications: Compatibility – Designed for Raspberry Pi 5 Storage – Onboard EEPROM for configuration data storage PCIe switch – ASMedia ASM1184e PCI express packet switch with 1x PCIe Gen2 x1 upstream port and 4x PCIe Gen2 x1 downstream [...]</p>

<p>RISC-V is an open architecture standard that provides flexibility, and chip designers can add or remove instructions as they please to match their application requirements. That&#8217;s all great until complex software designed to run on multiple platforms is involved. That&#8217;s why for Linux and Android support, the RVA (RISC-V Application) profiles were created, so that every RISC-V SoC designed for those systems meets some minimal requirements and shared instructions, to which you would also add more if needed, as long as they don&#8217;t break the standard. The RISC-V association ratified the latest RVA23 profile for 64-bit RISC-V in October 2024, which notably mandates support for the vector and hypervisor extensions. OMGUbuntu also reports that Canonical has decided to raise the required RISC-V ISA profile family to RVA23, or more exactly RVA23U64, from RVA20 for the upcoming Ubuntu 25.10 release. In other words, going forward, Ubuntu will only be supported on [...]</p>

<p>The Kappa4310Rasp is a Raspberry Pi-compatible Modbus RTU HAT designed to evaluate the IS4310 Modbus RTU Slave stack chip. This allows engineers to simulate sensor and actuator interactions using a push-button and RGB LED without requiring a custom board or soldering. The board features an RS-485 interface with two RJ45 connectors for daisy-chaining Modbus networks. The board communicates with the Raspberry Pi over I²C and supports 500 Holding Registers along with Function Codes 3 (Read Holding Registers), 6 (Write Single Register), and 16 (Write Multiple Registers). The HAT operates at 3.3V and includes jumpers to enable or disable onboard I²C pull-ups. Additional features include dedicated Tx/Rx indicator LEDs, a power LED, GPIO-connected RGB LEDs, and a push-button for real-time interaction. Kappa4310Rasp board specifications: Modbus RTU stack chip &#8211; IS4310 (I²C interface, 500 Holding Registers) Protocol support &#8211; Function Codes 0x03 (Read), 0x06 (Write Single), 0x10 (Write Multiple) Communication &#8211; RS485 [...]</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about Meshtastic firmware and hardware since 2020, but I never had the opportunity to test it myself. This has now changed as Elecrow sent us the ThinkNode M1 and ThinkNode M2 Meshtastic nodes for review. Both rely on Semtech SX162x radios, but the M1 is based on a Nordic Semi nRF52840 Bluetooth MCU with a 1.54-inch E-Ink display and GPS, and the smaller M2 is based on an ESP32-S3 chip and a 1.3-inch OLED but lacks a built-in GPS module. Since I&#8217;ve never used Meshtastic before, this &#8220;review&#8221; will be more like a Getting Started Guide from a beginner&#8217;s perspective. After an unboxing and a teardown, I&#8217;ll test messaging, GPS sharing, and the range I can get in a suburban environment in Thailand. ThinkNode M1/M2 unboxing Both packages look similar, with a plastic case and a white cover. The ThinkNode M1&#8217;s main features include a high-gain antenna, [...]</p>

<p>The datasheets, user manuals, and Linux SDK for the Allwinner A527, T527, and A733 SoCs, found in some SBCs like the Avaota A1, Radxa Cubie A5E, Orange Pi 4A, and upcoming Cubie A7A, are now available on Gitlab without any NDA requirements. Allwinner SoCs used to be some of the most popular processors for SBCs in the years 2012 to 2015 due to their feature set, low cost, and support by the sunxi-linux community. Since then, interest has plummeted due to a lack of interest in open-source software by Allwinner management and the constant release of new low-cost &#8220;Cortex-A7&#8221; SoC, and Rockchip RK3566 or RK3588 are now preferred on non-Raspberry Pi SBCs.  But we first heard Allwinner say they planned to work on mainline Linux support for the Allwinner A527/T527 at the Orange Pi Developer Conference in March 2024.

<p>Grant Sinclair&#8217;s GamerCard is a handheld console based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and a 4-inch color IPS display offered in an ultrathin design that&#8217;s about the size of a typical retail gift card. It joins other Raspberry Pi-based handheld terminals like the BeepBerry, ShaRPiKeebo, or DevTerm, but it&#8217;s more of a consumer device and offers by far the slimmest design at just 6mm thick. Being described as a &#8220;Grab &#38; Go Raspberry Pi Gaming&#8221; platform, it&#8217;s mainly designed as a portable gaming console, but since it&#8217;s based on Raspberry Pi hardware, you could also use it as a battery-powered Linux terminal connected to a USB keyboard and mouse, and it also offers expansion capabilities through a Qwiic connector.

<p>We have already checked out the specifications, assembled the machine, and performed basic tests with the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra CNC Router in the first part of the review. We&#8217;ve now had time to use the machine to carve text and logos on wood and aluminum. It was Suthinee&#8217;s first CNC machine, so the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra was reviewed from the point of view of a beginner. We used both the offline controller with files provided on the SD card and the Easel web-based CNC software.

<p>Embedr is an AI-powered Arduino-like IDE designed to simplify development for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. It looks very similar to the Cursor code editor and uses Microsoft’s Monaco Editor and Arduino CLI tools to enable features such as intelligent code suggestions, project skeleton generation, and visual debugging. Embedr has all the Arduino features that you are familiar with, and on top of that, you can add other LLMs and experiment just by adding the required plugin and connecting them via API keys. We’ve previously seen Arduino release their Claude-based Arduino Cloud Editor, which runs in the browser for context-aware coding assistance. But the problem with that is, if you don’t have internet, you can’t use the IDE. Embedr runs locally and uses Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash LLM, meaning you can compile and debug your code offline without needing a constant internet connection. Additionally, Embedr gives you greater control and privacy compared to [...]</p>

<p>There are already many cheap ESP32 drones on AliExpress, or you can even make an ESP32 DIY drone for about $12, but 01Studio&#8217;s pyDrone is a little different as it&#8217;s based on an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module and runs MicroPython firmware instead of the ESP32-Drone firmware. The pyDrone can be controlled over WiFi or Bluetooth using the pyController gamepad, also based on the same ESP32-S3 module. Another advantage of the pyDrone is that it comes with a connector for the OV2640 camera module that&#8217;s often missing in other low-cost ESP32 drones. pyDrone specifications: Wireless Module &#8211; ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 SoC – ESP32-S3N8R8 CPU &#8211; Dual-core Tensilica LX7 up to 240 MHz RAM &#8211; 512KB SRAM, up to 8MB PSRAM Storage &#8211; 8MB flash Wireless – WiFi 4 and Bluetooth LE 5 Antenna &#8211; PCB antenna Motors &#8211; 4x 716 hollow cup motors Blades &#8211; 46mm propeller blades Flight range WiFi &#8211; 120 meters Bluetooth [...]</p>

<p>We have already checked out the hardware of the GEEKOM Mini IT12 2025 Edition mini PC with an unboxing and a teardown in the first part of the review. The new model still relies on a 12th Intel processor, and simply replaced the 10-core Intel Core i7-12650H by a more powerful 14-core Intel Core i7-1280P processor still coupled with 32GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB M.2 SSD, although the brands and models of the RAM, storage, and wireless modules have changed. In the second part of the review, we will be testing the GEEKOM Mini IT12 2025 Edition mini PC with the pre-installed Windows 11 Pro in detail, notably testing most features and running benchmarks before comparing it to the (2023 Edition) Mini IT12 mini PC with an Intel Core i7-12650H processor.

<p>SunFounder has sent me a review sample of the Pironman 5 Max Tower PC case for the Raspberry Pi 5 SBC. We had already reviewed the Pironman 5 last year, but the new Max model has various improvements, including a sleeker design made of black aluminum and semi-transparent black acrylic panels, a dual NVMe PiP expansion board for two M.2 NVMe SSDs (optionally in RAID 0/1 configuration), or one NVMe SSD and one AI accelerator module, a Tap-to-Wake feature for the OLED information display, and programmable RGB LEDs for the two fans. So the Pironman 5 Max deserves another review of its own.  I&#8217;ll be doing an unboxing, going through the assembly instructions and software installation, before testing the new features, and finally, the cooling efficiency of the solution.

<p>AnyShake Explorer is a relatively affordable, open-source hardware seismic monitoring system that offers an alternative to the Raspberry Shake earthquake monitoring solutions. The device supports up to three 3-axis geophones and integrates a 3-axis accelerometer and a 32-bit ADC for measurements. You just need to connect it to a host like a laptop or an SBC such as a Raspberry Pi, an Orange Pi, a Radxa ROCK, or a NanoPi over a USB to RS232 cable to get started.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>

<div class="yt-embed">
.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }<div class="embed-container"></div>
</div>

<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p></div>
