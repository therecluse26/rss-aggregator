<p>Designed by Altware Dev Shop in the US, the Blackout Comms is an off-grid, LoRa-based encrypted mesh communication system built around ESP32 for texting and GPS location sharing without the need for any cellular networks or internet. The device uses asymmetric encryption and digital signatures for secure communication during blackouts, emergencies, or in remote areas where connectivity is unavailable. The device seemed a little bit pricey at first, but the complete kit includes two customized T-Deck communicators and one Altware Link/Node, all pre-configured and ready to use. Each communicator features a DFRobot GPS, Adafruit DS3231 real-time clock, 5000 mAh battery (≈48-hour runtime), external antenna, and PETG printed case, while the Link/Node integrates its own GPS, RTC, 3000 mAh+ battery, and antenna for cluster support. The system forms a private cluster with encrypted, frequency-hopping communication, signed delivery confirmations, and distributed mesh caching. Beyond messaging and location, it also supports proximity/motion sensing [...]</p>

<p>MNT Reform has launched a crowdfunding campaign for the RCORE V2 module powered by a Rockchip RK3588 SoC coupled with up to 32GB RAM, and a 256GB eMMC flash for the company&#8217;s open-source hardware laptops, be it the original MNT Reform or the MNT Reform Pocket. It appears to me that it&#8217;s the same module as found in the MNT Reform Next 12.5-inch laptop scheduled to ship by the end of December, but it&#8217;s sold separately as an upgrade kit for users of previous models of MNT Reform laptops. The company explains that the RCORE V2 brings a third M.2 slot for fast PCIe-based Wi-Fi cards (with USB Bluetooth), and it&#8217;s easier to install since it works without an internal HDMI adapter.

<p>Cloud costs can quickly grow faster than a startup&#8217;s growth, but with the right strategy, small teams can control expenses without compromising performance. Oversized or idle resources quietly drain budgets, and for startups, every unnecessary expense is money not invested in product, customers, or development. Over time, this quiet drain slows progress. The solution is to manage infrastructure with intention: right-size resources, automate scaling, and monitor usage closely. With the right approach, startups can keep cloud spending under control while maintaining the performance, scalability, and reliability needed to deliver an intense experience for their users. The Startup Cloud Cost Challenge Many startups overspend on cloud services because they focus on building, selling, and launching, rather than fine-tuning their infrastructure. This can lead to a few common missteps: Paying for more compute power than necessary Running services around the clock, even when idle Choosing complex infrastructure designed for enterprise workloads rather [...]</p>

<p>Forlinx Embedded FET3506J-C is an ultra-small system-on-module (SoM) based on Rockchip RK3506J triple-core Cortex-A7 SoC measuring just 40 x 29mm, and equipped with up to 512MB DDR3, and 256MB NAND flash, or 8GB eMMC flash. I first thought I had already written about it, but the Forlinx FET3506J-S module introduced last March has a different design. It measures 44 x 35mm and exposes all I/Os through castellated holes, while the FET3506J-C features two 80-pin board-to-board (B2B) connectors instead. The company also provides the OK3506J-C single board computer for evaluation, but considering the module is inserted into the carrier board, as opposed to soldered, the carrier board could potentially be used with future modules using the same B2B connectors design. Forlinx FET3506J-C system-on-module Specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3506J/B CPU 3x Arm Cortex-A7 core up to 1.5 GHz (RK3506J) or 1.6 GHz (RK3506B) Arm Cortex-M0 real-time core @ 200 MHz GPU – [...]</p>

<p>For hobbyists, small businesses, and engineers in Europe and the United States, prototyping printed circuit boards (PCBs) is a critical step in turning innovative ideas into reality. However, one significant barrier often stands in the way: high shipping costs. These expenses can quickly inflate the total cost of small-scale PCB orders, making prototyping less accessible for individuals and startups with limited budgets. Few PCB manufacturers offer significant discounts on small-scale orders, and shipping fees can sometimes rival or even exceed the cost of the PCBs themselves, discouraging experimentation and innovation. To address this issue, ALLPCB, a leading PCB manufacturing and assembly provider, has launched an exciting new campaign designed to make PCB prototyping more affordable for everyone. New users can now enjoy $30 off their first PCB order, plus an additional $30 off shipping costs. What sets this offer apart is its flexibility—there are no limitations on PCB size, number [...]</p>

<p>TrueNAS Scale NAS platform was designed to work on x86-64 computers only, but there&#8217;s now an unofficial port for 64-bit Arm (Aarch64) targets running a UEFI bootloader, including the Raspberry Pi 4/5 SBCs and other higher-end Arm boards. Previously known as FreeNAS, the community edition, FreeBSD-based TrueNAS Core was phased out in 2022 and replaced with the Linux-based TrueNAS Scale. iXsystems also provides TrueNAS Enterprise, a paid version with more advanced features, but all versions only work on 64-bit x86 machines. TrueNAS forum user Joel0 decided to change that and patched TrueNAS Scale to run on ARM (aarch64). The main requirements are having a 64-bit Arm target, at least 8GB RAM, 16GB boot storage, and a working UEFI bootloader. The image has been tested with a QEMU virtual machine, and it should also work on a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 with UEFI, but it has not been tested. One [...]</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

<p>Renasas RA4C1 microcontroller (MCU) group is based on an 80-MHz Arm Cortex M33 core and designed for utility meters and battery-powered IoT applications. It&#8217;s especially suited to devices that require advanced security and segment LCD support, such as smart locks, thermostats, building controls, and industrial user interfaces. The RA4C1 is very similar to the Renesas RA4L1 MCU designed for HMI applications, but it comes with more RAM (96KB vs 64KB), and being optimized for Smart Meters lacks features like capacitive touch and audio output. The new MCU group still comes with up to 512KB code flash, 8KB data flash, plenty of I/Os, and a low-power consumption down to 168 µA/MHz in active mode, and a standby current of less than 1.79 µA with all SRAM retained.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Since I saw some posts calling out the old (now deprecated) way to increase GTT memory allocations for the iGPU on AMD APUs (like the AI Max+ 395 / Strix Halo I am <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">testing in the Framework Mainboard AI Cluster</a>), I thought I'd document how to increase the VRAM allocation on such boards under Linux—in this case, Fedora:</p>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit
</code></pre>

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>
