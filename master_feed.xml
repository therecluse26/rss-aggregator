<p>We&#8217;ve already checked out the hardware of the ZimaBoard 2 micro server in the first part of the review with an unboxing and a teardown of the Intel N150 mini PC, followed by a first boot to ZimaOS and a walk-through of the web dashboard to see what features it had to offer. I&#8217;ve now connected two SATA drives to the ZimaBoard 2 and done further testing with ZimaOS, notably checking system information and testing storage and networking performance. I also installed Ubuntu 24.04 on the ZimaBoard 2 for further testing for people preferring to use the system as a mini PC with SATA storage. ZimaOS v1.4.1 update When I connected to the web dashboard again, there was a new update for ZimaOS v1.4.1.

<p>We have received a review sample of an energy metering device from SeeedStudio called the XIAO 2-Channel Wi-Fi AC Energy Meter (XIAO-2CH-EM). This device uses a clamp-on CT (Current Transformer) method on the live wire that you want to measure, without needing to modify the existing electrical wiring. XIAO-2CH-EM comes with several key features such as dual CT sensors (CT1 and CT2), native ESPHome &#38; Home Assistant Integration, precise measurement with factory calibration, and bi-directional power flow monitoring. While the XIAO-2CH-EM has 2 CT input ports, it will only ship with one CT clamp by default, but users can purchase an additional CT clamp if needed. The two CT channels operate independently, and each one can measure bidirectional power and supports devices using up to 100A of current. That should be enough for an ordinary home. The XIAO-2CH-EM comes pre-flashed with ESPHome firmware from the factory, meaning it can be [...]</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve seen x86 mini PCs for under $100 a few times, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen one going for under $50, and that&#8217;s exactly what the Wo-we HU-MNPC05-L mini PC has to offer as the system is sold for $44.99 on Amazon with an old Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core Gemini Lake Refresh processor first introduced in 2019. What&#8217;s even more surprising is that it&#8217;s not a barebone model like cheaper mini PCs usually are, but it ships with 4GB of RAM and a 128GB eMMC flash. No sane person would likely attempt to use the thing as a Windows Desktop, but it may be an option for Linux distributions for workloads similar to what you would typically run on a Raspberry Pi 4/5, or for older Windows applications, or as a basic HTPC.

<p>Jetway PIC-ASL1 is a low-power, fanless Pico-ITX SBC built around the Intel Atom x7213RE or x7433RE Amston Lake SoC for industrial use. This SBC is very similar to the Alder Lake-N-based JPIC-ADN1, which Jetway released just last year. While both boards support up to 32GB DDR5 memory and dual displays via HDMI 2.0b and LVDS/eDP, the PIC-ASL1 adds industrial-grade resilience with shock/vibration resistance, a Nano SIM slot for cellular connectivity, and an Intel PTT for security. It also features a similar I/O layout, including dual USB 3.2 Gen 2, four USB 2.0, serial headers, two M.2 expansion slots, and a SATA III port for storage. Additionally, the PIC-ASL1 complies with various industrial standards, making it more suitable for use in harsh industrial environments compared to the ADN1.

<p>Colonel Panic&#8217;s Mesh Mapper is a project designed to map drones emitting the FAA&#8217;s Remote ID over WiFi or Bluetooth with location, altitude, pilot position, and identification data. This project utilizes an ESP32-C3 or ESP32-S3 to capture Remote ID transmissions within range, and then feeds the data into a Python Flask web application part of Mesh Mapper that provides real-time visualization and logging.  Meshtastic allows multiple detection nodes to share information across a mesh network, so several ESP32 nodes can be deployed in an area and be alerted when drones fly within your property or neighborhood. While you could use your own ESP32-C3/S3 board and Meshtastic hardware for this project, Colonel Panic designed a breakout board for XIAO ESP32C3 or ESP32S3 WiFi &#38; Bluetooth module and Heltec LoRa 32 V3 connected over serial to make things easier. Something like the XIAO ESP32S3 for Meshtastic &#38; LoRa devkit might also do, [...]</p>

<p>When I used the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 with a Raspberry Pi 4 as part of the Raspberry Pi AI camera review, I just placed the kit on a smartphone stand, but it was somewhat awkward and not super stable. Waveshare has now introduced the PI5-CASE-TD2 protective case for the 7-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 and the Raspberry Pi 5 that neatly combines the two, and also supports mounting to standard tripods. The company also claims it works with some other 7-inch displays. The enclosure gives access to all main ports of the Raspberry Pi 5, including Gigabit Ethernet, the four USB ports, the 40-pin GPIO header for Raspberry Pi HATs, the PCIe FFC connector, micro HDMI ports, the power button, and the USB-C port for power. I initially thought it would be compatible with the Raspberry Pi 4 too, but since the USB ports and Ethernet ports [...]</p>

<p>xMEMS Labs µCooling fan-on-a-chip solution now supports solid-state drives (SSDs) used in NVMe M.2 SSDs used in laptop PCs and enterprise E3.S form factor SSDs used in AI data centers with a temperature reduction of as much as 30%. The solution is based on the same technology as the xMEMS XMC-2400 1 mm-thin micro cooling fan-on-a-chip introduced last year, and aims to replace passive heat spreaders and flow from system fans with a hyper-localized active cooling directly to the NAND flash and controller ICs from within the SSD itself, making it mostly invisible to the user and enabling thinner and more dense designs. If the illustration pictured above matches reality, the xMEMS µCooling fan-on-a-chip is not placed in the chips themselves, contrary to a similar solution like AirJet, but in a strategic location on the SSD&#8217;s PCB, so that it can blow air to cool the chips.

<p>Revopoint Trackit is a high-end optical 3D scanner that achieves accurate object tracking for small to large workpieces without needing markers on the object&#8217;s surface. This significantly increases scanning efficiency over conventional marker-based 3D scanning systems. The 3D scanner features an optical tracking system ensuring smooth scanning despite complex shapes, angle changes, or position shifts, maintaining stable data acquisition. The scanner offers two scanning modes with a 30-line cross blue laser mode for quick scans and a single-line blue laser mode for capturing narrow, hard-to-reach areas. Both laser modes can deal with dark and shiny surfaces without the need to first apply scanning spray, making it great for capturing delicate workpieces like circuit boards. Other highlights include a wide operating range suitable for small to large pieces (think coins to cars), auto gimbal calibration, and the ability to operate the device as a standalone handheld scanner (with markers).

<p>Radxa ROCK 4D is yet another Rockchip RK3576 SBC, but offered in a credit card form factor similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 model with the usual 40-pin GPIO header, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and four USB ports. We first noticed it when we covered the Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT, and I&#8217;ve just seen it added to the Linux 6.15 release, so I thought it might be a good time to cover it, especially since it&#8217;s already for sale on Allnet and AliExpress starting at $31 plus shipping. Radxa ROCK 4D specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3576 or RK3576J (industrial-grade version) CPU – Octa-core  CPU with 4x Cortex-A72 cores at 2.2 GHz, 4x Cortex-A53 cores at 2.0 GHz GPU – Arm Mali-G52 MC3 GPU with support for OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, and 3.2, OpenCL 2.0, and Vulkan 1.2 NPU – 6 TOPS (INT8) AI accelerator with support for INT4, INT8, INT16, [...]</p>
