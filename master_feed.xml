<p>If you found the Pironman 5 and Pironman 5 Max Tower PC cases for the Raspberry Pi 5 pretty cool, but had a hard time justifying paying much more for the enclosure than for the board itself, SunFounder has an update for you. The company has now introduced the Pironman 5 Mini Tower PC enclosure with a similar, yet smaller design, fewer features, and easier assembly, bringing the price down to $45.99. That means the OLED information display, most RGB LEDs, the oversized tower cooler, the micro HDMI to HDMI adapter board, and more are all gone. Pironman 5 Mini features: Compatible SBC &#8211;  Raspberry Pi 5 only. The Raspberry Pi 4 won&#8217;t work, and I can&#8217;t think of another SBC with two micro HDMI ports and the exact same layout as the Pi 5.

<p>Jetway’s MTX-TWL1 is a fanless industrial Mini-ITX motherboard built around the Intel Processor N250 or N150 Twin Lake processor designed for embedded and IoT applications. It supports up to 32GB DDR5 memory, triple 4K display, dual 2.5GbE, SATA, and M.2 slots for NVMe, wireless, or 4G LTE/5G cellular connectivity. Additionally, it features six COM ports, USB 3.2, Type-C with DP Alt Mode, GPIOs, and a wide power and temperature range, making it suitable for In one of our last posts, we wrote about the Jetway JMTX-ADN8, which shares the same Mini-ITX form factor but is powered by Alder Lake-N processors instead. The boards have quite a different layout, but they both use DDR5 SO-DIMM memory, M.2 slots, SATA port, and a wide operating temperature range from -20°C to 60°C for industrial applications.

<p>In the past, we have seen various consumer-grade Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based robot dogs like the Petoi Bittle and XGO 2, as well as the XGO Mini Pro built around the Kendryte K210/K510 AI processor. Waveshare has launched another option. WAVEGO Pro is a 12-DOF bionic quadruped (robot dog) with dual ESP32/Raspberry Pi control, real-time feedback servos, a 5MP ultra-wide camera, and an open-source web-based control interface. The ESP32 sub-controller handles all real-time, low-level motion control tasks, wireless connectivity, and the optional Raspberry Pi 4B/5 host controller handles higher-level functions such as OpenCV vision processing, AI-driven decision-making, and advanced control logic. The robot uses 2.3 kg·cm serial bus servos, and the chassis is built using 5052 aluminum alloy and PA12 nylon structure with 40 bearing joints for smooth, reliable movement. For self-balancing, this robot dog has a 9-axis IMU, and for other controls, it includes ESP-NOW host–sub mode, JSON task-file [...]</p>

It&#8217;s a kind of AI Super Resolution implementation for games, where rather than upscaling videos, the AI accelerator upscales graphics to lower the required bandwidth and increase the frame rate (or lower the power consumption) with no impact on the rendering quality. Watch the video below to see a demo rendered at 540p resolution by the GPU and upscaled to 1080p resolution by Arm neural technology with no obvious defects. The upscaler will introduce some lag, but only about 4ms per frame in sustained performance conditions, as explained in a technical blog about the Arm Neural and NSS announcement: We assume a target of 10 TOP/s per-watt of neural acceleration [...]</p>

<p>Alif Semiconductor unveiled the Ensemble E4, E6, and E8 dual-core Cortex-M55 Edge AI microcontrollers and fusion processors, all equipped with Arm Ethos-U85 with the ability to run small language models (SLM) on-device while consuming just 36mW of power on the E4 SKU. Besides the ability to handle generative AI workloads, the new microcontrollers also integrate two power-efficient Ethos-U55 NPUs for AI vision. They can perform power-efficient object detection in less than 2ms and image classification in less than 8ms. Other highlights include support for up to two MIPI CSI image sensors, a fully hardware-accelerated image signal processor (ISP) pipeline operating at up to 60 FPS at 2MP resolution, and a new wide memory subsystem to enable an inferencing speed of well under a millisecond.

<p>Supermicro is better known for its x86 servers, and they have already produced higher-end Arm-based servers like the Ampere-based MegaDC product line, but no compact Arm servers so far. The ARS-E103-JONX-H2 embedded system, featuring an 8-core Arm CPU, four gigabit Ethernet ports, and a 10GbE RJ45 port, is almost that, but not quite. Instead, it&#8217;s another NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX-powered fanless embedded PC for imaging, industrial automation, digital signage, retail, healthcare, and other Edge AI applications. It also features three M.2 sockets for storage, wireless, and cellular connectivity, an HDMI 2.0 video output, four USB 3.2 ports, two RS232/RS485 connectors, and a terminal block with digital inputs and outputs. &#160; Supermicro ARS-E103-JONX-H2 specifications: System-on-Module &#8211; NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX CPU &#8211; 8-core Arm Cortex-A78AE processor GPU &#8211; 1024-core NVIDIA Ampere GPU with 32 Tensor Cores System Memory &#8211; Up to 16GB RAM AI Performance &#8211; Up to 157 TOPS in &#8220;Super&#8221; [...]</p>

<p>Geniatech XPI-3576 is another Rockchip RK3576 SBC with up to 16GB RAM, up to 128GB flash, a M.2 Key B+M socket for storage or AI accelerator, HDMI 2.1 video output, MIPI DSI and CSI connectors, Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, a few USB ports, a 40-pin GPIO header, and a terminal block with RS232, RS485, and CAN Bus interfaces. Genatech launched the XPI family in 2018, starting with the XPI-S905X single board computer, which follows the Raspberry Pi 3 form factor. Since then, all other XPI boards leverages Raspberry Pi Model B or Zero form factors, but the XPI-3576 is a little different, as the Rockchip RK3576 board is based on what I would call an &#8220;Extended Credit Card&#8221; form factor (125 x 56mm), enabling extra features such as a proper M.2 2280 socket, while keeping compatibility with (most) Raspberry Pi HATs.

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`

sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit

<p>Argon 40 is better known for its Argon ONE Raspberry Pi enclosures, but the company has now launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Argon ONE UP 14-inch laptop powered by the Raspberry Pi CM5 module. We&#8217;ve already covered a range of Raspberry Pi 4/5 laptops, but existing models are either rather thick or the Raspberry Pi 5 is placed on the side of a laptop shell, not ideal for portability. The Argon ONE UP looks like a proper laptop, as thin as a typical consumer laptop, while keeping Raspberry Pi features such as access to the GPIO pins. The description is rather garbage, like on all recent Kickstarter campaigns we&#8217;ve covered, with low-resolution GIF animations and text in photos (instead of actual text), but I did my best to reconstruct the Argon ONE UP specifications: SoM &#8211; Raspberry Pi CM5 (included or BYO) SoC – Broadcom BCM2712 CPU – Quad-core [...]</p>

<p>Hengbot Sirius is a small AI robotic dog that can be trained by users with &#8220;manual teaching&#8221; and by developers using tools such as Sirius Creator Studio Pro and C or Python APIs. Features include an 8MP camera, a dual-mic array, and a speaker for user interaction using LLMs, text-to-speech, voice recognition, and computer vision leveraging the built-in 5 TOPS AI accelerator, a small LCD, a few RGB LEDs and sensors, and 14 DoF for legs and the head. We&#8217;ve seen plenty of other robot dogs over the years, such as the Hiwonder MechDog, the Raspberry Pi CM4-based CM4 XGO Lite smart robot dog, Mini Pupper 2, and Petoi Bittle, among others. Most are more robot-like than dog-like, and the Sirius has a more appealing design closer to a real dog.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>But it's not just self-hosting.</p>
