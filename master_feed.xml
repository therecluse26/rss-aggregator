<p>Sipeed has released a new variant of its NanoKVM-USB low-cost USB KVM adapter, which upgrades 2K 30 FPS capture and 4Kp30 loop out to 4K 60 FPS capture and 4Kp60 HDMI loop output. The new NanoKVM-USB 4K keeps the same ports as the earlier model, with HDMI and USB-C inputs connected to the target, and another USB-C port that connects to the host, in order to remotely control the target with keyboard, mouse, and monitor emulation. A USB Type-A port that can switch between host and target modes is also implemented, for instance, to share a USB drive between the two systems. NanoKVM USB 4K specifications: Video Input/Output HDMI input up to 4Kp60 from target device (no changes here) HDMI loop output up to 4Kp60 for optional connection to a monitor USB USB Type-C port for connection to the target device for keyboard/mouse emulation USB 3.0 Type-C port for connection [...]</p>

<p>We first noted the UltraRISC UR-DP1000-powered Milk-V Titan mini-ITX motherboard when we wrote an article about three high-performance RISC-V processors to watch in H2 2025. There have been some delays, as there often are, but the Titan board finally appears to be in stock, so it&#8217;s probably a good time to have a closer look. Powered by a 2 GHz UR-DP1000 octa-core RISC-V CPU, the Titan mini-ITX motherboard supports up to 64GB DIMM memory and M.2 NVMe storage (PCIe Gen4 x4), and features a PCIe Gen4 x16 slot for a graphics card or other expansion, Gigabit Ethernet, four USB 3.0 ports, a BMC, and more.

<p>Xibo digital signage solution is now compatible with the Raspberry Pi 5 thanks to Axeribo, an unofficial alternative to the digital signage player for Xibo, that is implemented in Rust, and designed for Linux platforms. Long-time readers of CNX Software may remember that I played around with the Xibo open-source digital signage player many years ago (2011-2012). I notably managed to run Xibo for Arm in QEMU,  test Xibo digital signage in the Raspberry Pi emulator, and even try it on real hardware: a MeLE A1000 Android TV box to which I installed Linux. It kind of works, but without hardware video decoding and no 3D graphics acceleration, performance was rather on the low side. I eventually stopped playing around with Xibo Arm Linux once Xibo for Android was released in late 2012, and the developers decided to drop support for the Linux client (although they relaunched it in 2019 [...]</p>

<p>The LILYGO T-Beam-1W is an ESP32-S3-based high-power LoRa development board featuring an SX1262 RF transceiver, an onboard 1W power amplifier (32 dBm), a L76K GNSS module, a 1.3-inch SH1106 OLED, a microSD slot, USB-C, Qwiic connectors, and an AXP2101 PMU. The board runs on a 7.4V battery and includes a cooling fan for high-power RF operation. We first wrote about the original LILYGO T-Beam (then branded as TTGO) in 2018, and since then, the company introduced various revisions of the T-Beam as it became popular. The T-Beam 1W is the most powerful version so far, with a built-in 1 Watt amplifier that allows the board to transmit data over longer distances without needing to buy separate, bulky amplifiers.

<p>At CES 2026, Sapphire Technology introduced the EDGE+VPR-7P132, an &#8220;AMD Embedded+&#8221; Mini-ITX motherboard built around AMD&#8217;s newly announced Ryzen AI Embedded P100 series of SoCs, namely the hexa-core Ryzen P132 (V4526iX) CPU, and an AMD Versal AI Edge Gen 2 VE3558 SoC FPGA, which features octa-core Arm Cortex-A78AE + ten Cortex-R52 real-time cores beyond FPGA fabric. It&#8217;s the first AMD Ryzen AI Embedded motherboard we&#8217;ve seen. It represents a massive update from last year’s Edge+ VPR-5050 motherboard, which relied on Zen 2-based Ryzen Embedded V2000 series and first-generation Versal silicon. The new VPR-7P132 skips multiple generations, jumping straight to Zen 5 CPU cores and RDNA 3.5 graphics, with an upgraded Versal Gen 2 adaptive Edge AI SoC for real-time inference, along with faster LPDDR5 (4266MHz) memory and 40 Gbps USB4 connectivity.

<p>When I wrote the Year 2025 in review post, I expected an announcement for the Wildcat Lake CPUs at CES 2026, but instead, Intel initially introduced the high-end Core Ultra Series 3 &#8220;Panther Lake&#8221; family. I assumed the Wildcat Lake announcement was postponed, but some users&#8217; reports on X indicate the company did demonstrate the new Core Series 3 (no &#8220;Ultra&#8221; there) &#8220;Wildcat Lake&#8221; processors as lower-end Core Series 3 &#8220;Panther Lake&#8221; SKUs. Intel has yet to disclose part names, and there&#8217;s nothing about the Wildcat Lake on Intel Ark at the time of writing. However, some information was shared through slides and X users. Intel Core Series 3 &#8220;Wildcat Lake&#8221; key features and specifications: CPU &#8211; Hexa-core processor with 2x Cougar Cover P-cores (Performance cores), 4x Darkmont LPE-cores (Low-Power Efficient cores) GPU &#8211; 2x Xe-core Intel Xe3 graphics (no ray tracing, not designed for gaming) AI accelerator &#8211; Intel [...]</p>

<p>After releasing the very powerful P895BD-AP AIoT module at CES 2026, Quectel now released two new low-power industrial AIoT modules based on NXP’s i.MX 9 series SoCs. The module integrates Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, and 802.15.4 radios through the IW610G chipset, so it can simply be dropped into a PCB to create a fully compliant Matter Border Router without any RF design or coexistence concerns. While both modules share the same 46 x 41.5 mm form factor and wireless capabilities, they are different in terms of  CPU power as the SRG091X is an entry-level solution built around a single-core NXP i.MX 91 processor, while the SRG093X features dual-core NXP i.MX 93 SoC, which includes a Cortex-M33 real-time core and a neural processing unit (NPU) for edge AI workloads.

<p>SpacemiT sent me a sample of the MUSE Book RISC-V Linux laptop for review. It&#8217;s based on the SpacemiT K1/M1 octa-core 64-bit RISC-V SoC, ships with up to 16 GB of RAM, eMMC flash and/or NVMe SSD, and features a 14.1-inch IPS display with 1920×1080 resolution, WiFi 6 connectivity, a few USB ports, and more. I won&#8217;t go through all the hardware specifications since Leo already did that when he wrote about the MUSE Book Laptop in April 2024, along with a teardown, and additional details about the SpacemiT K1/M1 SoC. I&#8217;ll still do an unboxing and quickly check the hardware, but I&#8217;ll focus on the software part to show the progress with Bianbu OS 2.3 (Ubuntu 24.04-based) on RISC-V hardware, as I just did for the low-end StarFive JH7110S-based VisionFive 2 Lite SBC. It&#8217;s quite a long review, so if you are short on time, you can jump directly [...]</p>

<p>Reolink has introduced the Elite Floodlight WiFi and Elite Pro Floodlight PoE, two new 4K security cameras with high-resolution video, integrated floodlights, PoE support (on the Pro model), and an on-device Large Language Model (LLM), which enables natural-language video search instead of basic object detection. We have reviewed various Reolink cameras over the years, such as the Argus PT Ultra, Reolink TrackMix PoE, and the RLC-810A, which features &#8220;Smart Detection&#8221; to the edge, allowing the camera to distinguish between people, vehicles, and pets without sending data to the cloud. However, they are limited to those fixed categories, and if you wanted to find something specific, like a &#8220;red shirt&#8221; or a &#8220;delivery truck,&#8221; you still had to scroll through the timeline manually, or rely on a networked video recorder (NVR). Reolink is now trying to solve that by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) directly into their new Elite Floodlight [...]</p>

<p>At CES 2026, Intel unveiled the Core Ultra Series 3 processors, codenamed Panther Lake-H, built on the Intel 18A (1.8-nanometer class) process, and targeting both consumer and industrial applications. Vecow introduced one of the first industrial Panther Lake-H platforms with the TGS-2000 series, a new family of ultra-compact, stackable Edge AI computers designed for high-performance space-constrained applications and based on either the 16-core Intel Core Ultra 9 386H or 12-core Intel Core Ultra 5 336H SoC. This new 2000 series is an upgrade of the previous TGS-1000 series, which was launched in 2024 with Intel Meteor Lake processors. While the overall design stays mostly the same, the transition to Core Ultra Series 3 enhances AI performance, reaching up to 100 TOPS combined performance with the selected SKUs (note: the top-end Panther Lake-H CPU can deliver up to 180 TOPS). The TGS-2000 Series is available in three variants, including the fanless [...]</p>

<p>AMD has introduced the Ryzen AI Embedded P100 and X100 x86 processors designed to power AI-driven applications at the edge, such as automotive digital cockpits, smart healthcare equipment, and humanoid robotics. AMD had previously launched several Ryzen Embedded families, starting with the Ryzen Embedded V1000 in 2018, and more recently, the Ryzen Embedded 8000 family with a 16 TOPS NPU, yet without &#8220;AI&#8221; in the name. The new AMD Ryzen AI Embedded family is based on high-performance “Zen 5” core architecture, an RDNA 3.5 GPU for real-time visualization and graphics, and an XDNA 2 NPU for low-latency, low-power AI acceleration. The P100 Series processors target in-vehicle infotainment and industrial automation, while the X100 Series processors feature higher CPU core counts and AI TOPS performance for more demanding physical AI and autonomous systems. Six models are currently available in the Ryzen AI Embedded P100 family: AMD Ryzen AI P121, P123, P121i, [...]</p>

<p>Nordic Semi nRF54ML20B Arm Cortex-M33 wireless SoC is the first nRF54L microcontroller to integrate the ultra-efficient Axon Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for edge AI workloads. The NPU is said to deliver up to 7 times faster performance and up to 8 times higher energy efficiency versus (unnamed) competing wireless solutions for tasks such as sound classification, keyword spotting, and image-based detection. The Axon NPU is also about 15x faster compared to using the Cortex-M33 CPU for the same task. Other than the NPU, the nRF54LM20B offers exactly the same features as the earlier nRF54LM20A wireless microcontroller, including up to 2 MB NVM, 512 KB RAM, a 128 MHz Arm Cortex-M33 plus RISC-V coprocessor, high-speed USB, up to 66 GPIOs, and an ultra-low-power 2.4 GHz radio supporting Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth Channel Sounding, Matter over Thread, and more as shown in the nRF54L comparison table below.

Espressif Systems has been teasing an upcoming Wi-Fi 6E SoC for several months, but so far, there have been very few details. Once tipped that the ESP32-E22 tri-band Wi-Fi 6E SoC was demonstrated at CES 2026, I headed over to X and noticed tks posted a few interesting photos from the exhibition. Here&#8217;s what we know about the ESP32-E22 so far: CPU &#8211; Dual-core RISC-V processor at up to 500 MHz Memory &#8211; 1 MB (no optional PSRAM) Wireless Tri-band 2.4/5/6GHz Wi-Fi 6E, 160 MHz channel bandwidth, 2&#215;2 MIMO; tested with iperf; up to 2.1 Gbps physical thoughput Dual-mode Bluetooth 5.4/6.0 (LE + BR/EDR) I/Os &#8211; 41x GPIO Host interfaces &#8211; PCIe 2.0, USB FS OTG, SDIO 3.0 (when used [...]</p>

<p>After announcing the high-end Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme and X2 Elite processors last year, Qualcomm has now introduced the mid-range Snapdragon X2 Plus platform at CES 2026. While the Elite SKUs target premium laptops, the X2 Plus series is designed for affordable, mainstream Windows 11 Copilot+ PCs. The new lineup includes the X2P-64-100 (10-core) and the X2P-42-100 (6-core), both manufactured on a 3nm process. What&#8217;s interesting is that they share the same 80 TOPS AI accelerator, 9523 MT/s LPDDR5x memory support, Snapdragon X75 5G modem, and FastConnect 7800 WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 as the flagship Elite models. This means that the X2 Plus reduces CPU core counts and GPU frequencies to maximize battery life for thin-and-light Windows 11 Copilot+ laptops, but it does not compromise on I/O, media capabilities, or AI performance, as it features the same USB4, PCIe Gen5, and AV1 video support as the top-tier models.

<p>Time for the last post of 2025, as the year is almost over. I&#8217;ll look back at key developments and notable products launched in 2025, share some CNX Software website traffic statistics, and look ahead to 2026. Year 2025 in Review After 22 product releases in 2024, Raspberry Pi calmed down a little bit in 2025, and the highlights of the year included the Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keyboard, the 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2, and a Raspberry Pi 5 1GB RAM. What didn&#8217;t quite stop were the accessories from third parties for Raspberry Pi SBC and Raspberry Pi Pico boards. The most exciting Arm SoC release of 2025 was probably the 12-core CIX P1 Armv9 SoC found in Radxa Orion O6 SBC, MINISFORUM MS-R1 Arm mini PC, and Orange Pi 6 Plus board, but while performance was fine, it was overhyped in 2024, and software [...]</p>

<p>StarFive has sent me a sample of the VisionFive 2 Lite RISC-V SBC for review. It&#8217;s a low-cost credit card-sized board based on the StarFive JH7110S quad-core RISC-V SBC and designed to get started with Linux RISC-V on the cheap. When I first tested the earlier VisionFive 2 SBC with a StarFive JH7110 RISC-V SoC in February 2023, I didn&#8217;t call it a review, but rather a hands-on experience, since, at the time, many features still didn&#8217;t work properly. Almost three years have passed since then, so reviewing the VisionFive 2 Lite SBC with Ubuntu 24.04 will allow us to see how much progress has been made on the software side. If you are in a rush, you can jump to the what works, what doesn&#8217;t section. VisionFive 2 Lite unboxing I received the board in a plastic box with a cover reading &#8220;VisionFive 2 Lite Your Gateway to RISC-V&#8221;. [...]</p>

<p>Hello, today I am going to review the HUSKYLENS 2, released in October 2025. It is the next generation of HUSKYLENS, an AI vision sensor equipped with a Kendryte K230 dual-core RISC-V SoC with a 6 TOPS AI accelerator and a 2.4-inch IPS touchscreen. The device runs machine vision algorithms fully on-device, providing fast and low-latency performance, and includes more than 15 built-in AI models. HUSKYLENS 2 also supports deploying custom-trained models, including integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) via a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service. In addition, it is compatible with various microcontrollers, such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, through UART or I2C communication interfaces. HUSKYLENS 2 unboxing The manufacturer sent the HUSKYLENS 2 module and the Microscope Lens separately. Both parcels were shipped from Chengdu, China, and arrived at my office in Chanthaburi, Thailand, in about one week. The parcels were packed in standard cardboard boxes and arrived [...]</p>

<p>In this blog post, I'll cover the base system, just one of the two nodes. Cluster testing is ongoing, and I'll cover things like AI model training and networking more in depth next year, likely with comparisons to the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/i-clustered-four-framework-mainboards-test-huge-llms">Framework Desktop cluster</a> and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/15-tb-vram-on-mac-studio-rdma-over-thunderbolt-5">Mac Studio cluster</a> I've also been testing.</p>

<p>Ever since I got <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/using-amd-gpus-on-raspberry-pi-without-recompiling-linux">AMD</a>, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/all-intel-gpus-run-on-raspberry-pi-and-risc-v">Intel</a>, and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/nvidia-graphics-cards-work-on-pi-5-and-rockchip">Nvidia</a> graphics cards to run on a Raspberry Pi, I had a nagging question:</p>
<p><em>What's the point?</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi only has 1 lane of PCIe Gen 3 bandwidth available for a connection to an eGPU. That's not much. Especially considering a modern desktop has at least one slot with 16 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 bandwidth. That's 8 GT/s versus 512 GT/s.

<p>Apple gave me access to this Mac Studio cluster to test RDMA over Thunderbolt, a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-26_2-release-notes#RDMA-over-Thunderbolt">new feature in macOS 26.2</a>. The easiest way to test it is with <a href="https://exolabs.net">Exo 1.0</a>, an open source private AI clustering tool. RDMA lets the Macs all act like they have one giant pool of RAM, which speeds up things like massive AI models.</p>
<p>The stack of Macs I tested, with 1.5 TB of unified memory, costs just shy of $40,000, and if you're wondering, no I cannot justify spending that much money for this. Apple loaned the Mac Studios for testing.

<p>We finally have Intel Arc GPUs working on the Pi <em>somewhat</em> stably—it required overcoming many small hurdles, but it looks like support could land in Raspberry Pi OS if we can get <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250715061837.2144388-1-zhangzhijie@bosc.ac.cn/">a simple patch upstreamed</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. If that happens, all you'd need to do to use an Intel card on a Pi is install a firmware package.</p>
<p>The cards I've spent the most time with so far are:</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 15:06:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Minisforum stuffs an entire Arm Homelab in the MS-R1</title><link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/minisforum-stuffs-entire-arm-homelab-ms-r1/</link><description><![CDATA[<figure class="insert-image"><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/minisforum-stuffs-entire-arm-homelab-ms-r1/minisforum-ms-r1-front.jpg"

<p>The <a href="https://s.minisforum.com/4hRFZbj">Minisforum MS-R1</a> uses the same Cix CD8180 Arm SoC as the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/radxa-orion-o6-brings-arm-midrange-pc">Orion O6 I reviewed earlier this year</a>. But everything else about this thing is different.</p>
<p>What this thing <em>should</em> be, is a box that runs Linux and can compete with at least an Apple M1 Mac mini, or a mid-range Mini PC. But what we <em>got</em>... is something different.</p>

<p>While the hot dog's flesh is getting vaporized, a tiny plasma arc moves the air around it back and forth. And because this tower is an AM tower, it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_modulation"><em>Amplitude</em> Modulation</a>, where a transmitter changes the amplitude of a carrier wave up and down. Just like a speaker cone moving up and down, the plasma arc from the hot dog turns that modulation into audible sound.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 7 Nov 2025 16:15:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Replacing Electrolytic Capacitors | VCF Midwest 2025 Talk</title><link>https://www.baldengineer.com/vcfmw2025.html</link><description><![CDATA[Slides PDF: Electrolytics are Ticking Time Bombs Bit Preserve: GitHub Repo with Vintage Computer Schematics in KiCad Bald Engineer&#8217;s Capacitor Video Playlist TRS 80 Model 100 Cap Replacement Spreadsheet (add a pitch column!)

Engineers and supply chain managers often ask whether polymer electrolytic capacitors can replace MLCCs. The replacement could be because of availability, or an application cannot tolerate the extreme capacitance loss with MLCC&#8217;s DC Bias Effect.
