<p>xMEMS Labs µCooling fan-on-a-chip solution now supports solid-state drives (SSDs) used in NVMe M.2 SSDs used in laptop PCs and enterprise E3.S form factor SSDs used in AI data centers with a temperature reduction of as much as 30%. The solution is based on the same technology as the xMEMS XMC-2400 1 mm-thin micro cooling fan-on-a-chip introduced last year, and aims to replace passive heat spreaders and flow from system fans with a hyper-localized active cooling directly to the NAND flash and controller ICs from within the SSD itself, making it mostly invisible to the user and enabling thinner and more dense designs. If the illustration pictured above matches reality, the xMEMS µCooling fan-on-a-chip is not placed in the chips themselves, contrary to a similar solution like AirJet, but in a strategic location on the SSD&#8217;s PCB, so that it can blow air to cool the chips.

<p>Revopoint Trackit is a high-end optical 3D scanner that achieves accurate object tracking for small to large workpieces without needing markers on the object&#8217;s surface. This significantly increases scanning efficiency over conventional marker-based 3D scanning systems. The 3D scanner features an optical tracking system ensuring smooth scanning despite complex shapes, angle changes, or position shifts, maintaining stable data acquisition. The scanner offers two scanning modes with a 30-line cross blue laser mode for quick scans and a single-line blue laser mode for capturing narrow, hard-to-reach areas. Both laser modes can deal with dark and shiny surfaces without the need to first apply scanning spray, making it great for capturing delicate workpieces like circuit boards. Other highlights include a wide operating range suitable for small to large pieces (think coins to cars), auto gimbal calibration, and the ability to operate the device as a standalone handheld scanner (with markers).

<p>STMicroelectronics has introduced the LSM6DSV320X, a compact AI-enabled inertial measurement unit (IMU) that integrates a 3-axis digital gyroscope, a 3-axis low-g accelerometer (±16g), and a 3-axis high-g accelerometer (±320g) in a tiny 3 x 2.5mm package, ideal for space-constrained IoT devices such as wearables, smartphones, gaming controllers, smart tags, personal safety gear, and industrial monitoring systems. Most motion sensors are designed to track daily activities or detect sudden impacts, but the LSM6DSV320X is built to do both. One accelerometer tracks everyday motion up to ±16g, while the other handles high-impact events up to ±320g. One of the most interesting features is its adaptive self-configuration (ASC), which allows real-time adjustment of internal settings based on activity without the need for a host CPU, optimizing power use and responsiveness. It also includes a machine learning core (MLC) capable of running up to eight decision trees and a finite state machine (FSM) to [...]</p>

<p>The UV Meter is a Flipper Zero application designed to measure ultraviolet (UV) radiation using the AS7331 spectral sensor, which can detect UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C wavelengths. Designed for personal and environmental UV monitoring, this tool measures UV exposure levels in everyday scenarios, whether it&#8217;s behind windows, under cloud cover, or while wearing sunglasses. It provides real-time irradiance readings in µW/cm², W/m², or mW/m², and calculates safe maximum daily exposure durations based on 2024 TLVs and BEIs from ACGIH, with adjustable factors like eye protection status, gain, and exposure time. A visual meter and warning symbols notify the user of under- or overexposure. The app also displays each UV type’s relative contribution to overall exposure risk. A compact adapter PCB enables easy connection between the Flipper Zero and the AS7331 breakout board via I²C.

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.15: So this was delayed by a couple of hours because of a last-minute bug report resulting in one new feature being disabled at the eleventh hour, but 6.15 is out there now. Apart from that final scramble, things looked pretty normal last week. Various random small fixes all over, with drivers as usual accounting for most of it. But we&#8217;ve got some bcachefs fixes, some core networking, and some mm fixes in there too. Nothing looks particularly scary. And this obviously means that the merge window opens tomorrow as usual, and I see the usual people being proactive and having sent me their pull requests. It&#8217;s memorial day tomorrow here in the US, but like the USPS, &#8220;neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night&#8221; &#8211; nor memorial day &#8211; stops the merge window.

One of the most interesting features of this MCU is Infineon’s fifth-generation CapSense MSCLP technology, which enables high-resolution, low-power capacitive sensing even in deep sleep mode (as low as 8 µA). Its capacitive sensing uses both self and mutual capacitance methods, supported by analog front-end filtering, sigma-delta modulation, and digital filtering techniques, delivering a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5:1 for accurate detection. The MCU supports gesture detection, human-machine interfaces (HMI), and smart sensing applications, making it ideal for wearables, consumer devices, and IoT systems. Additional features include a 12-bit 1-MSps SAR ADC, six TCPWM blocks, smart I/O with programmable logic functions, multiple UART/I2C/SPI interfaces, and up to [...]</p>
