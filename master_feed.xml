<p>Qualcomm has just signed an agreement to acquire Arduino, and the goal of the purchase is to &#8220;combine Qualcomm’s leading-edge products and technologies with Arduino’s vast ecosystem and community to empower businesses, students, entrepreneurs, tech professionals, educators, and enthusiasts to quickly and easily bring ideas to life.&#8221; They also took the opportunity to launch the Arduino UNO Q &#8220;dual-brain&#8221; SBC powered by a Qualcomm DragonWing QRB2210 SoC running Linux and an STMicro STM32U585 MCU for real-time control, as well as the Arduino App Lab integrated development environment to &#8220;unify the Arduino journey across Real‑time OS, Linux, Python, and AI flows&#8221;. Will the acquisition change anything? I suppose we&#8217;ll see more and more Arduino boards based on Qualcomm processors, but the company also promises to preserve Arduino&#8217;s open approach and community: Arduino will retain its independent brand, tools, and mission, while continuing to support a wide range of microcontrollers and microprocessors [...]</p>

<p>wafer.space has launched its first pooled silicon fabrication run on Crowd Supply, called the GF180MCU Run 1, which enables designers, engineers, and companies to create 1,000 custom ASICs using GlobalFoundries’ 180 nm mixed-signal process.  Each slot provides a fixed 3.88 × 5.07 mm (19.67 mm²) die area replicated 1,000 times, meaning you will receive 1000 chips, with options for bare dies or chip-on-board packaging. The GF180MCU process supports 5 metal layers, MIM capacitors (~2.0 fF/µm²), poly and high-res poly resistors, and standard-Vt MOS devices. Users can handle their own pad ring, ESD, and I/O layout while wafer.space manages fabrication, dicing, and shipping from Singapore. Designs can be open or closed source, and full wafers are also available for advanced testing or collection. Designs are submitted to wafer.space as GDSII files (the standard file format for chip layouts). Wafer.space automatically checks these files to make sure they can be manufactured correctly.

<p>Since Debian 13 &#8220;Trixie&#8221; was released last August, it was just a matter of time until Raspberry Pi OS followed. Raspberry Pi announced the update from Bookworm to Trixie a few days ago. The new Raspberry Pi OS images get the new and updated packages from Debian 13, and features like 64-bit time support to solve the Y2K38 bug. However, as Simon Long, UX engineer at Raspberry Pi, points out, there have been fewer changes in newer versions of Debian, and most changes in the new version of Pi OS are cosmetic, although there are some interesting under-the-hood changes as well. The most obvious change from the user&#8217;s perspective is the new theme featuring a completely new set of icons, a new font (Nunito Sans Light), new desktop backgrounds (the new default is a photo of the sun rising over the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho), and some other small tweaks.

<p>The price of DDR4 memory has increased dramatically in recent months due to limited supply and increased demand for AI workloads. The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 and 5 (CM4/CM5) are based on LPDDR4 memory, and Raspberry Pi reports that memory costs are roughly 120% higher than they were just a year ago. So they have no choice but to increase the price by $5 to $10 for the CM4 and CM5, as well as the Raspberry Pi 500 keyboard PC. I assume the $200 price tag for the Raspberry Pi 500+ mechanical keyboard PC released last week already includes this new reality. Product affected: 4GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $5 8GB Compute Module 4 and Compute Module 5 variants increase by $10 Raspberry Pi 500 unit-only increases by $10 to $100 Raspberry Pi Development Kit for Compute Module 5 increases by $5 to [...]</p>

<p>Linux 6.17 has just been released on LKML: No huge surprises this past week, so here we are, with kernel 6.17 pushed out and ready to go. Below is the shortlog for just the last week &#8211; not the full 6.17 release &#8211; as usual. It&#8217;s not exciting, which is all good. I think the biggest patch in there is some locking fixes for some bluetooth races that could cause use-after-free situations. Whee &#8211; that&#8217;s about as exciting as it gets. Other than that, there&#8217; the usual driver fixlets (GPU and networking dominate as usual, but &#8220;dominate&#8221; is still pretty small), there&#8217;s some minor random other driver updates, some filesystem noise, and core kernel and mm. And some selftest updates. This obviously means that the merge window for 6.18 will open tomorrow, and I already have four dozen pull requests pending. Thanks to the proactive people &#8211; you know who [...]</p>

<p>LUNYEE has sent us a review sample of the 4040 PRO CNC router, featuring a larger work volume than the LUNYEE 3018 Pro Ultra model we reviewed a few months ago. It is designed for milling and engraving tasks that demand high precision and features a robust structure to support continuous operation. It works with wood, plastic, and acrylic. Its standout feature is the complete set of accessories, such as the Probe system for Z-axis setup and a workpiece clamping kit, allowing users to get started right away. This makes it an ideal CNC Router for beginners in engraving work. We&#8217;ve previously reviewed the smaller 3018 Pro Ultra with Easel, but we&#8217;ll instead use Candle software on the 4040 PRO machine.

<p>Fing has recently introduced the &#8220;Fing Agent Raspberry Pi Kit&#8220;, also called &#8220;Fing Agent plug-and-play Raspberry Pi 4 kit&#8221;, for its Fing Agent network monitoring system, which can be considered a follow-up to the earlier Fingbox hardware released in 2017. While Fingbox was a custom appliance based on Ubuntu Core, the new kit uses a Raspberry Pi, making it easier to set up and use in a home or small office network. The kit includes a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB) in an aluminium case, a 32GB microSD card with Fing Agent preinstalled, a USB-C power supply with adapters, and a Cat 5e Ethernet cable. Once connected to the router, it works with the Fing app, desktop, or web to monitor devices, track uptime and speed, detect intrusions, and send alerts about unusual activity.

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is moving from cloud-first architectures to edge-first designs, so more processing now runs on phones, cameras, and embedded controllers. Running inference on-device cuts latency and keeps sensitive data local. This momentum is reshaping product roadmaps, all due to different revolutions driven by edge AI. The Core Revolutions Driven by Edge AI Instead of routing every model and signal to the cloud, devices are processing more data locally to act faster and protect sensitive information. Because edge AI is changing where intelligence runs, IDC estimates global spending on edge computing reached about $261 billion in 2025. This rapid enterprise investment is due to several reasons. 1. Enabling Real-Time, On-Device Decisions Eliminating the cloud round-trip lets devices turn sensor input into action in milliseconds.

<p>Raspberry Pi CM0 is a yet-to-be-officially-announced castellated Compute Module based on the Raspberry Pi RP3A0 SiP (System-in-Package) found in the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3E (CM3E). Since most Raspberry Pi products are announced under a strict embargo, I&#8217;m always surprised when I find new Raspberry Pi hardware that was never formally introduced. But it seems to happen from time to time for products targeting business customers specifically. The CM3E Compute Module was one example, and the CM0 appears to be another.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>For a great many tech YouTube channels, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/youtube-views-are-down-dont-panic">views have been markedly down</a> from desktop ("computer") users since August 10th (or so).</p>

<p>This month-long event has kicked up some dust—enough that two British YouTubers, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGTKaALdHzc">Spiffing Brit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX1eEe8erkQ">Josh Strife Hayes</a> are having a very British argument<sup id="british"><a href="#fn:british" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> over who's right about the root cause.</p>

<p>Spiffing Brit argued it's a mix of YouTube's seasonality (it's back to school season) and channels falling off, or as TechLinked puts it, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZ5pATTvc2o">git gud</a>", while Josh Strife Hayes points out the massive number of channels which identified a <em>historic</em> shift down in desktop views (compared to mobile, tablet, and TV) starting after August 10. This data was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FUJwXeuCGc">corroborated by this Moist Critical video</a> as well.</p></div>
