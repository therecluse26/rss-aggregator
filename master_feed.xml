<p>The Pebble Smartwatch was first introduced in 2012 with a black and white e-Paper display, a week of battery life, and an amazingly successful Kickstarter company that raised over 10 million dollars. It was followed by the Pebble Time with a color display in 2015, and the Pebble 2 &#38; Time 2 watches followed in 2016. But then it all went south from there, and Pebble&#8217;s assets were purchased by Fitbit in December 2016, all projects were canceled that year, and cloud services were discontinued in June 2018. Since then, the community has taken over working on the Rebble project to keep existing watches running, and Google acquired Fitbit in 2021. However, the project is slowly coming back to life. First, Google released the source code for the Pebble smartwatches and Pebble’s founder, Eric Migicovsky, and a team of engineers worked on reviving the project which now culminates with the [...]</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi RP2350 dual-core Cortex-M33/RISC-V MCU was first unveiled along with the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 in August 2024. Since then we have covered many Raspberry Pi RP2350 news and boards, but the microcontroller was hard to source for hobbyist and low-volume projects, which partially explains why companies like NextPCB had promotions offering free PCBA prototyping services for RP2350 designs. The good news is that Raspberry Pi has just announced general availability for the RP2350 microcontrollers starting at $0.80 per unit for the RP2350A in 3,400-piece reels, or $1.1 in single quantity, so anybody can buy the MCUs from their favorite distributor. The British company also announced the RP2354A and RP2354B variants with 2MB of stacked flash memory would soon be available to select partners and mass production will ramp up later this year.

<p>OpenMV has launched two new edge AI camera boards programmable with MicroPython: the OpenMV AE3 powered by an Alif Ensemble E3 dual Cortex-M55, dual Ethos-U55 micro NPU SoC, and the larger OpenMV N6 board based on an STMicro STM32N6 Cortex-M33 microcontroller with a 1 GHz Neural-ART AI/ML accelerator. Both can run machine vision workloads for several years on a single battery charge. The OpenMV team has made several MCU-based camera boards and corresponding OpenMV firmware for computer vision, and we first noticed the company when they launched the STM32F427-based OpenMV Cam back in 2015. A lot of progress has been made over the years in terms of hardware, firmware, and software, but the inclusion of AI accelerators inside microcontrollers provides a leap in performance, and the new OpenMV N6 and AE3 are more than 100x faster than previous OpenMV Cams for AI workloads. For example, users can now run object [...]</p>

<p>Pine64 has launched an updated version of the PineTab-V RISC-V tablet with the same StarFive JH7110 SoC, 8GB RAM, and 128GB eMMC flash, but a few small hardware changes, and a Debian-based Linux image maintained by StarFive themselves. The PineTab-V is not exactly a new RISC-V tablet since it was launched in 2023, but at the time it was reserved for developers since it shipped with nothing&#8230; Users had to install the OS (that did not support the display yet) themselves, and work on the software/OS to improve it. The new model still targets developers and enthusiasts/early adopters, but at least now there&#8217;s a Debian 12 image optimized for the PineTab-V. The hardware is mostly the same, except Pine64 added an accelerometer, a status LED, an ID for the PineTab-V in the EEPROM, and a fix for slow charging while the tablet is turned off.

<p>Patrick Yang, CTO at WCH, has recently unveiled the CH570 RISC-V SoC with 2.4GHz wireless and USB 2.0 (host &#38; device) as an upgrade to the popular CH32V003 general-purpose RISC-V MCU with more features at the same low price (10 cents). CH570 also comes with 12KB SRAM and 256KB flash (vs 2KB SRAM and 16KB flash for the CH32V003), offers up to twelve GPIO,  six PWM, I2C, UART, SPI, and a 20-channel key detection module. There&#8217;s also the CH572 with the same features, except it also supports Bluetooth LE 5.0. As a side note, I wrote about the CH572 RISC-V MCU with BLE in 2019, but I guess it was scraped likely because it had OTP instead of flash&#8230;, and the new CH572 (2025) is different.

<p>But recently, the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6497">Intel WiFi drivers were added by default</a>, and now all that's required is loading in the right firmware.</p>

<p>Synaptics unveiled an extension to its Astra Native AI platform with the new SR series of MCUs. This new product family, unlike the Astra SL series released last year, isn&#8217;t comprised of Linux-capable application processors. Instead, the Arm Cortex-M55 microcontrollers focus on providing high-performance, AI-native processing for Edge AI applications leveraging a built-in Arm Ethos-U55 NPU. Built on the Arm Cortex-M55 core and the Arm Ethos-U55 neural processing unit (NPU), these MCUs are optimized for multimodal applications, including vision, audio, and voice processing. As indicated in the MCU&#8217;s block diagram (see below), the SR series also features an optional low processing SoC unit featuring an Arm Cortex-M4 @ 100MHz and a Synaptics micro NPU engine. Such a provision in this MCU is what allows the three operation tiers the company offers with the MCU series: performance, efficiency, and ultra-low-power modes, allowing intelligence across various power levels.

<p>Consumer-grade heat pipe cooling solutions typically rely on water as a working fluid. This works great until a system needs to be used in freezing conditions, since the water could turn into ice and damage the pipe or even parts of the computer. That&#8217;s why congatec has unveiled a heat pipe cooling solution that relies on acetone as a working fluid in the heat pipes instead of water. It will work reliably at extreme sub-zero temperatures down to -40°C, and the company also claims the solution is insensitive to mechanical stresses such as shock and vibration. The acetone-based cooling solution will be used in conjunction with Computer-on-Module (COMs) from the company such as the COM Express Type 6 conga-TC675 or rugged-version conga-TC675r powered by up to 45W Intel Raptor Lake processor, as well as COM HPC Mini, Client or Server modules.

<p>I&#8217;ve just reviewed the SunFounder 10.1-inch touchscreen display with Raspberry Pi 5 running Raspberry Pi OS, and the experience was not quite as smooth as I had expected, so I&#8217;ll report some tips to save people time. The first is the software keyboard. Matchbox keyboard used to be the go-to solution, but two years ago, my preferred keyboard became the Onboard keyboard. Sadly, it&#8217;s not working so well with the latest Raspberry Pi OS using labwc Wayland window-stacking compositor, so now Raspberry Pi recommends squeekboard. It was not installed by default, but installation is fairly easy: [crayon-67dacee347afc053284304/] It did not show up automatically when trying to type in a text field, maybe because I&#8217;m using a third-party touchscreen keyboard, but going to Raspberry Pi Configuration and setting On-screen Keyboard to Enabled always in the Display tab fixed that. I was able to type a URL/web search terms in the URL [...]</p>

            <p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: <em>it depends</em>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>About one year ago, I bought an Intel N100 mini PC (specifically the <a href="https://amzn.to/41EtTMk">GMKtec N100 NucBox G3</a>) and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/when-did-raspberry-pi-get-so-expensive">compared it to the Raspberry Pi 5 8GB</a>.</p>

<p>A year later, and we have <a href="https://amzn.to/41gFu2O">a newer $159 16GB version of that mini PC</a> with a slightly-faster Intel N150, and a new <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/who-would-buy-raspberry-pi-120">16GB Raspberry Pi 5</a>.</p>

            <p>With the release of a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows11arm64">Windows 11 for Arm ISO</a>, it's easier than ever to get an officially-supported install of Windows on many different Arm PCs—now including a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://worproject.com/">Windows on R</a> seems like it has run out of steam, as many open source initiatives do, after years of being bludgeoned with support requests being the only way to really get Windows going on a Pi.</p>

<p>But GitHub user (and <em>high-schooler</em>) Botspot just emailed me his <a href="https://github.com/Botspot/bvm">BVM</a> project, short for 'Botspot Virtual Machine'.</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Nvidia GPUs have been running fine on Arm for a while now—I just upgraded the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/system76-built-fastest-windows-arm-pc">System76 Thelio Astra</a> to an RTX 4080 Super and am testing it now.</p>

<p>But Nvidia seems to have a partnership with Ampere, which probably leads to their drivers getting priority support, and likely a few special edge cases in code to work around a couple PCIe quirks on the Altra CPUs. Nvidia <em>also</em> builds their own Arm CPUs—a <em>lot</em> of them—so Arm support is definitely a priority for them.</p>

            <p></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLt5YhOubxk&amp;t=207s">power went out for the first time in my studio space</a>, and that meant all my servers just had power cut with no safe shutdown.</p>

<p>Handling power outages is never a top priority... until it's the <em>only</em> priority! And by then it's usually too late! Luckily for me, no data was lost, and my servers all came back up safely.</p>

<p>This week the power company emailed and said they'd be cutting power for maintenance next week, but they don't have an exact time. So it's even more excuse to finally set up NUT on a Pi!</p>

            <p>Recently, I've been working on a Pi router build with multiple 2.5 Gbps Ethernet ports using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/647">Radxa's Dual 2.5G Router HAT</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted a simple way to check on total network TCP throughput using <em>both</em> interfaces (or really, as many interfaces as possible) to multiple computers on my network, and I noticed <code>iperf3</code>'s <code>--bind</code> option (like <code>--bind [ip address of interface]</code>) was not splitting the traffic on both interfaces—it would just route all traffic through one!</p>

<p>Luckily, I found the issue <a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/1572">Failing to bind to interface when multiple interfaces are present</a>, and in it, @bmah888 mentioned the <code>--bind-dev</code> option, which is new as of iperf 3.10+.</p>

<p>Using that option (like <code>--bind-dev [interface name]</code>), you can force an instance of iperf3 to bind to one particular device. For example, assuming I have two servers on my network running <code>iperf3 -s</code>, I can run the following on the Pi to saturate both connections as much as the Pi will allow:</p>

It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>
