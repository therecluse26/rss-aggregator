<p>Microchip Technology&#8217;s ATMXT3072M1 and ATMXT2496M1 add to the existing maXTouch M1 automotive touchscreen controllers and are designed for large, curved, free-form displays, including ones using OLED and microLED technologies. These controllers support up to 112 reconfigurable touch channels (or 162 in ultra-wide mode), enabling touch functionality for displays up to 20-inch (16:9 format) or 34-inch (7:1 format) in size. Additionally, they use smart mutual touch acquisition to enhance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by +15 dB, ensuring reliable touch detection in high-capacitive environments.  The controllers also feature integrated Knob-on-Display (KoD) technology for physical control knobs on touchscreens and low-latency haptic feedback for enhanced user interaction. The controls meet ASIL-A and B safety standards and support OTA firmware updates with SHA-512 authentication for cybersecurity compliance (ISO 21434:2021). All these features make these MCUs suitable for user-friendly infotainment and dashboard systems.

<p>ELEGOO sent us the Saturn 4 Ultra 16K Resin 3D printer for review. As its name implies, the 3D printer features a 10-inch LCD with a resolution of up to 16K (14112&#215;7936 pixels) to print sharper and more detailed workpieces. The printer also offers WiFi and Ethernet connectivity, and an automatic print base detection and leveling system to increase accuracy and reduce errors while printing. We were also provided with the ELEGOO Mercury Plus 3.0 wash and cure station for the review. It is designed to be easy to use, supports both water and alcohol washing, and is equipped with a 405nm UV light to increase strength and reduce the stickiness of the workpiece.

<p>SiFive's <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">HiFive Premier P550</a> is a strange board. It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've tested—though I haven't tested a <a href="https://milkv.io/pioneer">Milk-V Jupiter</a>. It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>

<p>Ubuntu 24.04.2 has just been released with Linux 6.11 kernel and hardware enablement (HWE) stack. I would typically not care too much about a point release, but our reviews of mini PCs have shown Ubuntu 24.04 with Linux 6.8 was not always well supported with recent mini PC, mostly due to issues with WiFi or Bluetooth, but sometimes it&#8217;s even worse. The most common problem I encountered was that MediaTek MT7922-based WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 module would not support Bluetooth on Ubuntu 24.04 unless we updated the Linux kernel to version 6.10 or newer. Mini PCs with recent processors like the Khadas Mind 2 AI Maker Kit based on Intel Core Ultra 7 258V AI SoC required even more tweaks for HDMI audio, GPU, and WiFi + Bluetooth which is why I tested it with Ubuntu 24.10 instead. Ubuntu 24.04.2 should solve all of those issues. The announcement explains [...]</p>

<p>STMicro first introduced the STM32C0 32-bit Arm Cortex-M0+ MCU family as an 8-bit MCU killer in 2023, followed by the STM32C071 adding USB FS and designed for appliances with graphical user interfaces (GUI). The company has now added three new parts with the STM32C051, STM32C091, and STM32C092. The STM32C051 is similar to the original STM32C031 but adds more storage (64KB vs 32KB) and is offered in packages with up to 48 pins, while the STM32C09x parts offer flash densities up to 256 KB in packages up to 64 pins, and the STM32C092 also gains a CAN FD interface. The STM32C09x parts can be seen as an update to the STM32C071 where more flash memory is needed. That&#8217;s 30 new SKUs bringing the total to 55 when different packages and flash memory size/RAM size options are taken into account. The STM32C051 offers the same maximal amount of SRAM as the STM32C031 [...]</p>

<p>People are trying to run LLMs on all sorts of low-end hardware with often limited usefulness, and when I saw a solar LLM over Meshtastic demo on X, I first laughed. I did not see the reason for it and LoRa hardware is usually really low-end with Meshtastic open-source firmware typically used for off-grid messaging and GPS location sharing. But after thinking more about it, it could prove useful to receive information through mobile devices during disasters where power and internet connectivity can not be taken for granted. Let&#8217;s check Colonel Panic&#8217;s solution first. The short post only mentions it&#8217;s a solar LLM over Meshtastic using M5Stack hardware. On the left, we must have a power bank charge over USB (through a USB solar panel?) with two USB outputs powering a controller and a board on the right. The main controller with a small display and enclosure is an ESP32-powered [...]</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.1.1  has just been released with official 200 MHz clock support for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 MCU, several new boards mostly from Waveshare, but also one from Sparkfun, as well as new code samples, and other small changes. Raspberry Pi RP2040 gets official 200 MHz clock support When the Raspberry Pi RP2040 was first released along with Raspberry Pi Pico in 2021, we were told the default frequency was 48 MHz, but the microcontroller could also run up to 133 MHz. Eventually, I think the Cortex-M0+ cores were clocked at 125 MHz by default, although some projects (e.g. PicoDVI) would boost the frequency up to 252 MHz. Frequencies higher than 133 Mhz were not officially supported so far, but the Pico SDK 2.1.1 changes that since the Raspberry Pi RP2040 has now been certified to run at a system clock of 200MHz when using a [...]</p>

<p>Youtuber and tech enthusiast Binh Pham has recently built a portable plug-and-play AI and LLM device housed in a USB stick called the LLMStick and built around a Raspberry Pi Zero W. This device portrays the concept of a local plug-and-play LLM which you can use without the internet. After DeepSeek shook the world with its performance and open-source accessibility, we have seen tools like Exo that allow you to run large language models (LLMs) on a cluster of devices, like computers, smartphones, and single-board computers, effectively distributing the processing load. We have also seen Radxa release instructions to run DeepSeek R1 (Qwen2 1.5B) on a Rockchip RK3588-based SBC with 6 TOPS NPU. Pham thought of using the llama.cpp project as it&#8217;s specifically designed for devices with limited resources. However, running llama.cpp on the Raspberry Pi Zero W wasn&#8217;t straightforward and he had to face architecture incompatibility as the old [...]</p>

<p>Connections between chips have become increasingly complex, and applications with higher frequency and speed requirements may not make use of traditional PCB technology. That&#8217;s where the interposer PCB, a new type of PCB comes into play. PCBWay has the capability to manufacture high-layer, high-order PCBs, and even successfully developed a 24-layer, 6-order arbitrary interconnection HDI PCB. The interposer PCB is a highly precise, high-density interconnect (HDI) PCB that allows for a higher wiring density per unit area compared to traditional PCBs. HDI PCBs are characterized by features such as micro vias, finer lines and spaces, higher connection pad density, and the use of blind and buried vias. These features enable the miniaturization of electronic devices by allowing more functionality to be packed into a smaller space. The design characteristics of this PCB include inner layers connected to the outer layers through laser microvias and dense routing, resulting in a multi-structure [...]</p>

            <p>Because I get the same question on every video where I recompile the Linux kernel on a Pi to work on GPU or other hardware driver support, I finally made a video answering it:</p>

<p><em>How do you recompile Linux?</em></p>

<p>In my case, since I mostly rebuild the kernel for the Pi, I rebuild <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux">Raspberry Pi's Linux kernel fork</a> instead of 'mainline' linux (the upstream <a href="https://www.kernel.org">Linux kernel source</a>).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi publishes a very thorough guide covering <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/linux_kernel.html#building">building and cross-compiling the Pi Linux kernel</a>, and my video today mostly goes through that (with a few little tips on making the experience more convenient):</p>

<p>You&#8217;d typically need hardware with a large amount of memory and bandwidth and multiple GPUs, if you want to run the latest large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek R1 with 671 billion parameters. But such hardware is not affordable or even available to most people, and the Exo software works around that as a distributed LLM solution working on a cluster of computers with or without NVIDIA GPUs, smartphones, and/or single board computers like Raspberry Pi boards. In some ways, exo works like distcc when compiling C programs over a build farm, but targets AI workloads such as LLMs instead.

<p>Waveshare has recently released the RoArm-M3-Pro and RoArm-M3-S, a 5+1 DOF high-torque ESP32 robotic arm kit. The main difference between the two is that the RoArm-M3-Pro features all-metal ST3235 bus servos for durability and longevity, on the other hand, the RoArm-M3-S uses standard servo motors which are less durable for long-term use. These robotic arms feature a lightweight structure, a 360° omnidirectional base, and five flexible joints, which together create a 1m workspace with a 200 grams @ 0.5m payload. A 2-DOF wrist joint enables multi-dimensional clamping and precise force control. It integrates an ESP32 MCU, supporting multiple wireless control modes via a web app, it also supports inverse kinematics for accurate positioning, curve velocity control for smooth motion, and adaptive force control. The design is open source and with ROS2 compatibility, it allows secondary development via JSON commands and ESP-NOW for multi-device communication.

<p>Sipeed NanoKVM-USB is an inexpensive and tiny full HD USB KVM solution with HDMI and USB-C inputs connected to the target, and another USB-C port that connects to the host remotely controlling the target with keyboard, mouse, and monitor emulation. The NanoKVM-USB also features a USB Type-A port that can be switched between host and target modes, for instance, to share a USB drive between the two computers. That&#8217;s the third KVM solution from Sipeed after the original NanoKVM KVM-over-IP cube relying on Ethernet connectivity to the host and the NanoKVM-PCIe that takes its power from a PCIe slot in the target machine while using Ethernet or WiFi 6 for connectivity to the host machine.

In addition to functioning as a smart wall switch, it can also act as a Zigbee Router, making it easier to expand your Zigbee network at home in one shot. One of the key features of the SONOFF ZBM5 is that it can either operate in with-neutral (N) or without-neutral (N) wiring setups. Typically, in the market, we see these as separate models: one for with-neutral and another for without-neutral. This feature adds more flexibility for users, especially those with wiring constraints in their homes. Let’s dive into the details. SONOFF ZBM5 Unboxing Inside the box, you&#8217;ll find a user manual, wall plugs, and the switch itself. The model we received has a rectangular shape (120mm) [...]</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Recently I've been <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/65">testing a SiFive HiFive Premier P550</a>, and as part of that testing, I <em>of course</em> plugged in some AMD GPUs I had laying around.</p>

<p>I'll get to that testing at a later date, but one thing I enjoy in my testing is finding what 3D accelerated games and other applications can be run on alternative architectures. With the great work from Wine and Proton over the years, a great many games run out of the box on Linux—and they can be made to run on Arm and RISC-V architectures with almost as much ease as Linux on X86/AMD64!</p>

            <p>RISC-V is the new entrant into the SBC/low-end desktop space, and as I'm in possession of a HiFive Premier P550 motherboard, I am running it through my usual gauntlet of benchmarks—partly to see how fast it is, and partly to gauge how far along RISC-V support is in general across a wide swath of Linux software.</p>

<p>From my first tests on the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/risc-v-business-testing-starfives-visionfive-2-sbc">VisionFive 2 back in 2023</a> to today, RISC-V has seen quite a bit of growth, fueled by economics, geopolitical wrangling, and developer interest.</p>

<p>The P550 uses the ESWIN EIC7700X SoC, and while it doesn't have a <em>fast</em> CPU, by modern standards, it is fast enough—and the system has enough RAM and IO—to run most modern Linux-y things. Including llama.cpp and Ollama!</p>

<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24.04.1 on my P550 board, and when I try running Ollama's simple install script, I get:</p>

            <p></p>

<p>A couple years ago, after I heard about the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cariboulabs/cariboulite-rpi-hat">CaribouLite on CrowdSupply</a>, I pre-ordered one.</p>

<p>I've dabbled in SDR with an <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ckxh5d">RTL-SDR v3</a> for a few years, even <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/hospital-stay-and-mlb-blackouts-led-me-rtl-sdr-radio">using one with nrsc5 to listen to baseball games OTA</a> because of silly MLB blackout restrictions.</p>

<p>But low-cost SDRs like the RTL-SDR v3 are receive-only, and have a limited frequency range, and lower quality RF filtering, so it can be frustrating if you're trying to work with lower-power RF... or trying to transmit at all!</p>

<p><code>top</code> (pictured <em>below</em>... above is <a href="#btop">btop</a>) is the first utility everyone recommends to monitor Linux (or any form of UNIX, including macOS) resource usage. It's efficient, available almost everywhere... but it's also a bit basic. It shows essential metrics, but looks like it's from the 80s. There are ways to brighten it up, like highlighting active processes or changing color schemes, but it's not the only game in town!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Nowadays, there are a <em>lot</em> of modern monitoring tools—and some not so modern, but immensely useful—to choose from. This blog post will run through some of the ones I rely on most often. Let me know in the comments if you use any others I didn't cover!</p>
