<p>Bluetooth 6.2 specification has just been released with a range of new features to enhance responsiveness with shorter connection intervals, strengthen security against amplitude-based RF attacks, and improve communication with a new &#8220;Bulk Serialization Mode&#8221; that&#8217;s especially useful for USB Bluetooth LE audio applications. The new Bluetooth Core 6.2 specification also introduces various BLE Test Mode enhancements. If you feel like Bluetooth specifications are released more often than in the past, that&#8217;s normal because the Bluetooth SIG switched to a bi-annual release schedule. For instance, the Bluetooth 6.1 specification was just published last May, or about 6 months ago&#8230; Bluetooth 6.2 highlights: Bluetooth Shorter Connection Intervals (SCI) reduce the minimum Bluetooth LE connection interval from 7.5 ms to just 375 µs for faster responsiveness. The change will especially impact high-performance HID devices, real-time human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and latency-sensitive sensors. AR/VR and gaming applications will particularly benefit from the lower latency. [...]</p>

<p>Collabora announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring upstream support to the Genio IoT SoCs and boards in  November 2024, but since the announcement was new at the time, no work had been done, and I didn&#8217;t write about it. However, almost one year later, Collabora can now report very good progress, especially for MediaTek MT8395 boards like Genio 1200 EVK and Radxa NIO 12L, which are now usable with mainline/upstream Linux since most features are implemented. But improvements also extend to MediaTek Genio 510 and Genio 700 EVKs, and the collaboration will continue with work on newer MediaTek Genio and Kompanio processors for IoT solutions and Chromebooks. The two MediaTek Genio 1200 boards can now boot mainline Linux without any out-of-tree patches while providing support for the Audio DSP, JPEG, video hardware encoders and decoders, the Arm Mali-G57 MC5 GPU (via the open source Panfrost driver), as well as [...]</p>

<p>LoRa Mesh solutions like Meshtastic or MeshCore enable off-grid messaging, GPS coordinates, and in some cases, audio communication for emergencies, working or hiking in remote areas, or simply to be able to communicate outside of cellular networks. However, adoption is limited, as users need to buy a terminal that costs about the same as an entry-level smartphone, or they may not see any use for it, except for emergencies. Integrating LoRa Mesh into Android smartphones can lower the cost of the feature, since the battery, enclosure, etc&#8230; are already there, and you just need to add a LoRa module and an antenna. That&#8217;s what SpecFive has done with the SpecFive Spectre Pro 4G LTE smartphone with a LoRa module. The rugged phone runs Android 12 and ships with Meshtastic, Mesh Tic Tac Toe, CheckTastic, and Mesh Chess.

<p>Creality has sent me the Sermoon S1 high-end 3D scanner for review. It supports blue laser line and infrared structured light scanning, offers high accuracy up to 0.02mm, scans objects from 5 x 5 x 5 m3 to 4000 x 4000 x 4000 mm3, and looks like a pretty cool device overall. I&#8217;ll start the review by diving into the specifications, before going through an unboxing to check out the 3D scanner and its accessories. I&#8217;ll then need to study a bit more before testing out with different objects in the second part of the review.

With the Steam Survey results for October 2025 coming out this evening, Steam on Linux has finally cracked the 3% threshold! A few months back Steam on Linux was close to 3% before stumbling a bit but now it's above that elusive threshold. The only time Steam on Linux use was close to the 3% mark was when Steam on Linux initially debuted a decade ago and at that time the overall Steam user-base was much smaller than it is today. Long story short, thanks to the ongoing success of Valve's Steam Deck and other handhelds plus Steam Play (Proton) working out so well, these October numbers are the best yet...]]></description><pubDate>Sun, 2 Nov 2025 00:45:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Review of Intel-based UP AI development kits – Part 1: Unboxing and first boot to Ubuntu Pro 24.04</title><link>https://www.cnx-software.com/2025/11/01/review-of-intel-based-up-ai-development-kits-part-1-unboxing-and-first-boot-to-ubuntu-pro-24-04/</link><description><![CDATA[<div><img width="720" height="410" src="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-720x410.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium wp-post-image" alt="UP AI Development Kits review" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" srcset="https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-720x410.jpg 720w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-1200x684.jpg 1200w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-768x438.jpg 768w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/UP-AI-Development-Kits-review.jpg 2048w" sizes="100vw" /></div>

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p></div>
