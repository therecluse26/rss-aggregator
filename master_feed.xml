<p>The WisGate Connect for MIOTY is an industrial-grade hybrid IoT gateway with support for both MIOTY and LoRaWAN protocols. Built around the RAK7391 carrier board for Raspberry Pi CM4, it is designed for long-range IoT applications, including intelligent street lighting, waste management, environmental monitoring, and traffic flow control. In addition to dual-protocol (MIOTY and LoRaWAN) support, it features USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and a USB-C port for flashing, an HDMI output, and a UART header for debugging. Backhaul options include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or an optional 4G LTE module. The gateway can be powered in two ways: a wide input voltage DC jack or terminal block, or optional PoE+. We first wrote about the MIOTY Standard back in April 2020. After that, in September 2021, we saw Silicon Labs introduce EFR32FG23 (FG23) and EFR32ZG23 (ZG23) SoCs with MIOTY support, but it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve covered products built around this standard.

Intel's top-of-stack Xeon 6300 (Xeon 6369P) / Xeon E processors fail to compete with even the mid-tier EPYC 4005 series processors in either performance, power, or cost effectiveness. Among the many advantages to these budget-friendly EPYC processors is having AVX-512 support with a full 512-bit data path compared to the Xeon 6300 series only having AVX2. For providing more insight into the AVX-512 performance impact with the AMD EPYC 4005 series, here are some enabled/disabled comparison benchmarks and how they are positioned relative to the Xeon 6369P server processor.]]></description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 19:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Proposal To Ship XLibre As X11 Server Packages On Fedora Linux Is Withdrawn</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-XLibre-Proposal-Withdraw</link><description><![CDATA[The controversial proposal to replace the upstream X.Org X11 server packages on Fedora Linux with XLibre is not going to happen...

            <p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p>

            <p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>


.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }


<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p>

<p>The ESPHome 2025.6.0 open-source firmware was released on June 18, 2025, with ESP32-P4 support and an initial OpenThread implementation for ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 SoCs, thanks to an upgrade to the ESP-IDF framework to version 5.3.2. The developers note that support for ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, and ESP32-P4 is still being refined, and some components may not yet be fully compatible with these chips, but additional component updates are planned for ESPHome 2025.7.0 next month. That still means that ESPHome devices can connect to Thread networks and communicate with Home Assistant through the Native API as long as you have an OpenThread border router and Thread is enabled in Home Assistant. Users should note some limitations to Thread support: ESPHome does not yet support the Thread “Sleepy End Device” mode Not recommended for applications requiring high-frequency sensor data transmission Best suited for simple control and monitoring use cases Other changes to ESPHome 2025.6.0 [...]</p>

<p>AAEON UP TWL and UP TWLS are two new credit card-sized single board computers (SBCs) based on the Intel Twin Lake processor family and operating in a wide -20°C to 70°C temperature range. Both models feature a Gigabit Ethernet port, three USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and an HDMI video output. The UP TWL SBC also comes with a 40-pin GPIO header, and the processor is underneath the board. The UP TWLS board has a thinner design once cooling is taken into account, similar to the UP 710S released late last year, with the processor positioned on top of the PCB, wafers for GPIOs and RS232/RS422/RS485, and an M.2 socket for WiFi.

<p>Back in 2022, we first saw STMicro launch the VL53L5CP ToF presence detection sensor for the PC market with features like user detection, gesture recognition, and intruder alert. Building upon that, the company has recently released its 5th‑generation Human Presence Detection (HPD) solution, built around the VL53L8CP 8×8 multizone Time‑of‑Flight sensor family with edge AI features offered as a turnkey solution for laptops, PCs, monitors, and accessories. We have seen and even tested earlier ToF sensors like the VL53L0X and VL53L1X, which used a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) for single-zone ranging. After that, we saw ST release the VL53L5, which was a major upgrade with up to 64-zone multi-zone support, enabling features like touch-to-focus and object tracking. Now, in the age of AI, ST has launched a 5th-gen turnkey HPD solution built around the VL53L8CP sensor.

<p>I&#8217;ve just received an electric skateboard for review: the MEEPO V5. I initially thought I would skip that one since it&#8217;s not super relevant to the usual topics covered on CNX Software, but seeing bolts on the photos, I figured out it might still be interesting to do a teardown of the skateboard to see how it works. So here I am. I&#8217;ll also go through an unboxing first, and check its features and performance. MEEPO V5 unboxing The package was quite larger and longer than I expected. That&#8217;s partially because there were two packages: one for the electric skateboard itself, and the other for a helmet. The skateboard is also quite bigger and heavier (8kg)  than the skateboards I tried to use when I was a child. The build quality looks excellent. There are some marks and dust on the wheels and deck because I tried it before taking [...]</p>

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest post by Ohad Peled, Product Marketing Manager at Sony Semiconductor Israel, about the challenges of tracking a large number of IoT assets and how LTE-M can help businesses scale tracking solutions. Over the last few years, asset tracking has emerged as a critical business function and is estimated to grow to a $34.5B market by 2032, according to Custom Market Insights. Whether businesses are monitoring a global supply chain or keeping tabs on expensive equipment, knowing where assets are at all times is essential. It enables businesses to optimize supply chains, prevent theft, and reduce operational downtime. There are several technical and commercial challenges in deploying such a solution, which could result in failure to deliver the promised value. Some solutions struggle to maintain accurate tracking as assets move within or across different facilities, especially if they go through an indoor environment. Others suffer from [...]</p>

<p>Pinefeat has designed an EF/EF-S lens controller and adapter for the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, compatible with Canon lenses, and implementing full electronic control of autofocus and aperture. Canon EF (Electro-Focus) and EF-S (Electro-Focus Short Back Focus) lenses are designed for the company&#8217;s DSLR cameras with an EOS (electronic autofocus system). They have great optics, built-in motors taking care of focusing, and also handle aperture electronically. Pinefeat is a fan of the Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, but it requires manual focus and aperture adjustment, and that&#8217;s why he created a controller and adapter compatible with Canon EF/EF-S lenses. The kit is comprised of the following components: Canon EF / EF-S lens to C-mount camera adapter with a plastic housing and some metal components (66 x 26.5mm) Lens control board Camera I/F &#8211; 15-pin MIPI CSI-2 FFC/FPC connector Camera mount &#8211; C-mount Lens mount &#8211; Canon EF or EF-S Host interface [...]</p>

We first came across this low-cost MCU back in March this year, and saw that the official development board became available for purchase as early as April. The nanoCH57x development board currently features the 100 MHz  CH572D RISC-V microcontroller (the CH570D version is coming later), which includes 256KB of flash memory, 12KB of SRAM, and an onboard 32 MHz crystal. The board also includes a USB 2.0 Type-C Host/Device port and PCB antenna for BLE/RF communication. MuseLab nanoCH57x development board specifications: MCU (one or the other) &#8211; WCH CH570D or CH572D CPU &#8211; QingKe 32-bit RISC-V3C core @ up to 100 MHz Memory – 12KB SRAM Storage – 256KB non-volatile memory 240KB code [...]</p>

<p>The AgroSense AGLW2CT is a dual-channel LoRaWAN-based industrial AC energy meter that utilizes 10A and 100A CT clamps to measure power consumption non-invasively. The device features two 0–5V analog inputs for the clamps, an AHT20 temperature &#38; humidity sensor, and local storage for 3,300+ records. It supports LoRaWAN 1.0.3 OTAA Class C and works with TTN, Datacake, and CloudStudio. The device operates within the -40°C to 85°C industrial temperature range and is suitable for contactless current sensing, overload/no-load detection, and machine health monitoring. We had previously covered, and even reviewed, several Wi-Fi-connected CT clamps meters such as the MachineQ&#8217;s MQpower CT, Seeed Studio&#8217;s XIAO-2CH-EM, and Emporia&#8217;s Vue Gen 2 energy monitor, but it&#8217;s the first time we&#8217;ve come across a LoRa AC energy meter with CT clamps. Earlier this month, we noticed the MOKO LW005-MP LoRaWAN Smart Plug and power meter, but it relies on direct AC power measurements and [...]</p>

<p>The NFC Forum has just announced NFC Release 15 that quadruples NFC range from 0.5cm to 2cm and enables faster, more reliable contactless interactions for wireless charging, kitchen appliances, wearables, and digital keys. The extended NFC range, also known as the operating volume, may make some people laugh since it&#8217;s only 2 cm we are talking about, but it has practical applications, as NFC contactless interactions will start sooner and require less precise device alignment. The NFC Release 15 also focuses on the NFC Digital Product Passport Standard to provide a data-agnostic framework allowing a single NFC tag to store and transmit both standard and extended DPP data using common NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) records. I wish I could explain how the extended NFC range and DPP standard are implemented in the new release, but I can&#8217;t because the technical specifications are only available for download to NFC Forum [...]</p>

<p>The ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 is a development board based on the ESP32-C61 low-cost WiFi 6 and Bluetooth LE 5.0 SoC that was first unveiled in January 2024, and has just entered mass production this month (June 2025). The board is offered with two USB-C ports, two buttons, an RGB LED, and GPIO headers. In my 2024 year in review report, I noted that Espressif would likely launch the ESP32-C5 dual-band WiFi 6 SoC in 2025, but I completely forgot about the ESP32-C61, which is basically a cost-down version of the ESP32-C6. The ESP32-C61-DevKitC-1 development board and ESP32-C61-WROOM-1 module are now available, so let&#8217;s have a closer look.

<p>Most ESP32-P4 boards and development platforms we&#8217;ve covered so far include an ESP32-C6 or ESP32-C5 wireless module, and in case you don&#8217;t want any WiFi and Bluetooth module, the Olimex ESP32-P4-DevKit is one option that comes with Ethernet instead. The ALIENTEK DNESP32P4M board, also called ESP32P4M MINI, adds another option with a form factor similar to Espressif Systems Devkit-C boards. The board does not have network connectivity at all, and exposes all I/Os from the ESP32-P4 through headers, MIPI DSI and MIPI CSI connectors, and two USB-C ports.

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p>

<p>I'm deep in the rabbit hole of all things time and timing. One step on any modern horologist's journey is GPS time.</p>

<p>NIST just <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-keeps-world-time">put NIST-F4 online</a>, accurate to within 2.2e-16 ppm (that's <code>0.00000000000000022</code> seconds. The clock is <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1681-7575/adc7bd">described in Metrologia</a> thusly:</p>

            <p>I've been deep into time and timing lately (more shenanigans coming tomorrow), but today I posted a video covering the install of a <a href="https://www.pctel.com/antenna-product/timing-antenna-with-integrated-lightning-protection/">PCTEL GPS/GNSS antenna</a> at my studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p>

            <p>For the past couple years, I have transported my 'working set' of video and project data to and from work on an external Thunderbolt NVMe SSD.</p>

<p>But it's always been <em>slow</em> when I do the sync. In a typical day, I may generate a new project folder with 500-1000 individual files, and dozens of them may be 1-10 GB in size.</p>

<p>The Thunderbolt drive I had was capable of well over 5 GB/sec, and my 10 Gbps network connection is capable of 1 GB/sec. I even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaV-O6NPWrI">upgraded my Thunderbolt drive to Thunderbolt 5 lately</a>... though that was not the bottleneck.</p>

<p>I used the following rsync command to copy files from a network share mounted on my Mac to the drive (which I call "Shuttle"):</p>

<pre><code>rsync -au --progress --stats /Volumes/mercury/* /Volumes/Shuttle/Video_Projects
</code></pre>

<p><code>mercury</code> is so named because it's a fast NVMe-backed NAS volume on my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-efficient-server-grade-arm-nas">Arm NAS</a> (all my network volumes are named after celestial bodies).</p>
