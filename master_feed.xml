<p>The Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) released the Matter 1.4 specification in fall 2024, and we skipped Matter 1.4.1 here, but decided to cover the Matter 1.4.2 release, which enables WiFi only provisioning, removing the need for a Bluetooth LE radio often only used for onboarding Smart Home devices. This will enable device makers to reduce costs and hardware complexity by removing the Bluetooth LE radio and the associated software stack in designs where a BLE radio is only used solely for commissioning. While Matter 1.4.2 is a minor dot release, it includes many other changes we&#8217;ll cover below. Matter 1.4.2 highlights: Wi-Fi Only Commissioning &#8211;  Relies on Wi-Fi Unsynchronized Service Discovery (USD), and removes the need for Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radios to onboard devices to the Matter ecosystems.

<p>Raspberry Pi introduced the 7-inch Touch Display 2 with 1280&#215;720 resolution and a thinner design last November. The company has now introduced a 5-inch variant of the Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 that sells for $40 instead of $60 for the 7-inch model. Besides the smaller dimensions, nothing much else changed, as the 5-inch Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2 keeps the same 1280&#215;720 resolution, 5-point multi-touch capacitive support, 24-bit RGB format, and so on. One difference is the viewing angle: 80° for the new 5-inch model, and 85° for the 7-inch variant.

<p>When RUIPRO asked me to review an HDMI cable, I almost immediately deleted their email. After all, who wants to review a dumb HDMI cable? But I still took a look and noticed that their cable used optical fiber, and they sold HDMI cables up to 300 meters long on Amazon.  My longest HDMI cable is about 1.5 meters long, so I got intrigued and asked for a 100-foot (30-meter) fiber HDMI cable for testing. RUIPRO fiber HDMI cable unboxing When I received the parcel, I got two boxes, so I thought there might be a receiver and a transmitter. But no, they must like me and sent two &#8220;8K detachable pure fiber HDMI cables&#8221;. The cables are said to be HDMI 2.1b compliant up to 8K resolution, and with support for future 10K and 12K resolutions. Other features listed include Dynamic HDR, eARC, uncompressed 8K60 Hz and 4K120 Hz, [...]</p>

<p>CNXSoft: This is a guest port by Erik Wierich, Senior Engineer at RISCstar Solutions, demonstrating a practical security implementation for embedded devices using standard Linux tools like dm-verity and TPM 2.0. It covers threat models, filesystem security, and TPM-based encryption with working code examples. Nowadays, it is (rightfully) impossible to put an embedded device into the market without comprehensive embedded device security measures. Most new devices store private data that we do not want to see leaked in dark corners of the Internet. We also want to avoid our device ending up as part of a botnet. Linux has a large set of tools to help us with security. What has historically been lacking is a simple, off-the-shelf way to integrate these tools into a secure-by-default configuration.

<p>If you found the Pironman 5 and Pironman 5 Max Tower PC cases for the Raspberry Pi 5 pretty cool, but had a hard time justifying paying much more for the enclosure than for the board itself, SunFounder has an update for you. The company has now introduced the Pironman 5 Mini Tower PC enclosure with a similar, yet smaller design, fewer features, and easier assembly, bringing the price down to $45.99. That means the OLED information display, most RGB LEDs, the oversized tower cooler, the micro HDMI to HDMI adapter board, and more are all gone. Pironman 5 Mini features: Compatible SBC &#8211;  Raspberry Pi 5 only. The Raspberry Pi 4 won&#8217;t work, and I can&#8217;t think of another SBC with two micro HDMI ports and the exact same layout as the Pi 5.

<p>In the past, we have seen various consumer-grade Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based robot dogs like the Petoi Bittle and XGO 2, as well as the XGO Mini Pro built around the Kendryte K210/K510 AI processor. Waveshare has launched another option. WAVEGO Pro is a 12-DOF bionic quadruped (robot dog) with dual ESP32/Raspberry Pi control, real-time feedback servos, a 5MP ultra-wide camera, and an open-source web-based control interface. The ESP32 sub-controller handles all real-time, low-level motion control tasks, wireless connectivity, and the optional Raspberry Pi 4B/5 host controller handles higher-level functions such as OpenCV vision processing, AI-driven decision-making, and advanced control logic. The robot uses 2.3 kg·cm serial bus servos, and the chassis is built using 5052 aluminum alloy and PA12 nylon structure with 40 bearing joints for smooth, reliable movement. For self-balancing, this robot dog has a 9-axis IMU, and for other controls, it includes ESP-NOW host–sub mode, JSON task-file [...]</p>

<p>Arm neural technology will add dedicated neural/AI accelerators to Arm GPUs launched in 2026 and beyond to deliver up to 50% GPU workload reduction for mobile games and other graphics-intensive apps. The first application is called Arm Neural Super Sampling (NSS). It&#8217;s a kind of AI Super Resolution implementation for games, where rather than upscaling videos, the AI accelerator upscales graphics to lower the required bandwidth and increase the frame rate (or lower the power consumption) with no impact on the rendering quality. Watch the video below to see a demo rendered at 540p resolution by the GPU and upscaled to 1080p resolution by Arm neural technology with no obvious defects. The upscaler will introduce some lag, but only about 4ms per frame in sustained performance conditions, as explained in a technical blog about the Arm Neural and NSS announcement: We assume a target of 10 TOP/s per-watt of neural acceleration [...]</p>

<p>You see, I was on a Reverse Engineering panel at Open Sauce, but <a href="https://x.com/geerlingguy/status/1945207387914178562">I mentioned on Twitter</a>, I wouldn't call myself a reverse engineer, more like a 'guy who breaks things sometimes taking them apart, and learns many ways to not break things, sometimes.'</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Growing up, I remember recording CRTs with <em>any</em> camera was an exercise in frustration. You would either get a black bar that goes across everything, a slowly moving 'shutter' of darkness over the screen, black frame flickering, or even a variety of bright artifacts, especially when moving the camera around.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/mac-classic-crt-line-recording.jpg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3a9e56b7-866b-43e0-a82d-b00fec535cca&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Mac Classic CRT with flicker line"></p>

<p>Just setting your camera's shutter speed to match the refresh rate <em>somewhat</em> closely is usually enough to make it at least bearable (I start at 1/60th and see what looks least annoying).</p>

<p>But I recently discovered, while recording an old Macintosh Classic's CRT, that my Sony A7CII has a built-in anti-flicker feature that's... actually amazing.</p></div>

<p>At the time, there was no option for upgrading the M4 Pro Mac mini, despite it <em>also</em> using a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121003">user-replaceable</a>, socketed storage drive.</p>

<p>But the folks at <a href="https://m4-ssd.com">M4-SSD</a> reached out and asked if I'd be willing to test out one of their new M4 Pro upgrades, in this case, upgrading the mini I use at the studio for editing from a stock 512 GB SSD to <em>4 TB</em>.</p></div>

<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>But it's not just self-hosting.</p>
