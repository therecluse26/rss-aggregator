<p>A month ago, I had a <em>second</em> video on self-hosting <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/self-hosting-your-own-media-considered-harmful-updated">taken down</a>. YouTube said it was 'harmful or dangerous content'. I appealed that, but my appeal was rejected.</p>

<p><em>Luckily</em>, I have enough reach I was able to get a <a href="https://x.com/TeamYouTube/status/1931119648675701161">second chance</a>. Most content creators aren't so lucky, and content about tools like Jellyfin and LibreELEC get buried over time.</p>

<p>But it's not just self-hosting.</p>

<p>There are already many cheap ESP32 drones on AliExpress, or you can even make an ESP32 DIY drone for about $12, but 01Studio&#8217;s pyDrone is a little different as it&#8217;s based on an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module and runs MicroPython firmware instead of the ESP32-Drone firmware. The pyDrone can be controlled over WiFi or Bluetooth using the pyController gamepad, also based on the same ESP32-S3 module. Another advantage of the pyDrone is that it comes with a connector for the OV2640 camera module that&#8217;s often missing in other low-cost ESP32 drones. pyDrone specifications: Wireless Module &#8211; ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 SoC – ESP32-S3N8R8 CPU &#8211; Dual-core Tensilica LX7 up to 240 MHz RAM &#8211; 512KB SRAM, up to 8MB PSRAM Storage &#8211; 8MB flash Wireless – WiFi 4 and Bluetooth LE 5 Antenna &#8211; PCB antenna Motors &#8211; 4x 716 hollow cup motors Blades &#8211; 46mm propeller blades Flight range WiFi &#8211; 120 meters Bluetooth [...]</p>

<p>SunFounder has sent me a review sample of the Pironman 5 Max Tower PC case for the Raspberry Pi 5 SBC. We had already reviewed the Pironman 5 last year, but the new Max model has various improvements, including a sleeker design made of black aluminum and semi-transparent black acrylic panels, a dual NVMe PiP expansion board for two M.2 NVMe SSDs (optionally in RAID 0/1 configuration), or one NVMe SSD and one AI accelerator module, a Tap-to-Wake feature for the OLED information display, and programmable RGB LEDs for the two fans. So the Pironman 5 Max deserves another review of its own.  I&#8217;ll be doing an unboxing, going through the assembly instructions and software installation, before testing the new features, and finally, the cooling efficiency of the solution. Pironman 5 Max unboxing I received the Pironman 5 Max in its retail package along with a Raspberry Pi AI Kit [...]</p>

            <p>I've had a Pi and SDR earmarked for 'getting weather data from my weather station' for a long time now. I don't know why I waited so long, because it was shockingly easy.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/44p0yFV">Acurite 5-in-1 weather station (with separate lightning detector)</a> mounted about 15' in the air in my back yard. It comes with a fancy little LCD display to show all the stats it transmits over the 433 MHz wireless frequency.</p>

<p>But I want to ingest that data into my Home Assistant installation, so I can have better access to historical data, set up alerts (like if wind speed is above 50 mph, or there's lightnining less than 10 miles away), etc.</p>

<p>I'll work on the HA integration later, likely using MQTT. But for now, just getting the data to decode on a Raspberry Pi 5 was quick:</p>

<p>The WisGate Connect for MIOTY is an industrial-grade hybrid IoT gateway with support for both MIOTY and LoRaWAN protocols. Built around the RAK7391 carrier board for Raspberry Pi CM4, it is designed for long-range IoT applications, including intelligent street lighting, waste management, environmental monitoring, and traffic flow control. In addition to dual-protocol (MIOTY and LoRaWAN) support, it features USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and a USB-C port for flashing, an HDMI output, and a UART header for debugging. Backhaul options include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or an optional 4G LTE module. The gateway can be powered in two ways: a wide input voltage DC jack or terminal block, or optional PoE+. We first wrote about the MIOTY Standard back in April 2020. After that, in September 2021, we saw Silicon Labs introduce EFR32FG23 (FG23) and EFR32ZG23 (ZG23) SoCs with MIOTY support, but it&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve covered products built around this standard.

            <p>I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Server's GitHub SSH pubkey importer for a long time, it's a quick and easy way when doing an interactive server installation to get the built-in OpenSSH server configured for remote SSH access.</p>

<p>However, many computers I work on have Ubuntu Desktop installed instead, and it doesn't even include OpenSSH Server in the default packages!</p>

<p>So I thought I'd write up a quick guide for how to set up SSH on Ubuntu Desktop pulling in my GitHub SSH public keys quickly, since I haven't found a similar guide elsewhere:</p>

<h2>Install OpenSSH</h2>

<p>Open Terminal and enter the commands:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSH is running with Ubuntu's default configuration. You can edit the configuration inside <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> if you want (make sure to <code>systemctl restart ssh</code> after doing so).</p>

<h2>Import your GitHub public keys</h2>

<p>Ubuntu includes a handy utility that does this for you:</p>

            <p>Over on the 2nd channel, I posted a video detailing my process for making thumbnails for my YouTube channel:</p>


.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }


<p>My videos target a more technical audience—and often deal with subjects crowds like those on HN might find interesting.</p>

<p>Technical audiences don't often enjoy the feeling of being 'bamboozled', especially in subtle ways that feels like marketing or deception.</p>

<p>Therefore YouTube thumbnails are often a contentious topic. In the early days, thumbnails were just a still frame from the video, meaning it was harder (but not impossible) to 'game the system' and introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait">clickbait</a>.</p>

<p>The ESPHome 2025.6.0 open-source firmware was released on June 18, 2025, with ESP32-P4 support and an initial OpenThread implementation for ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2 SoCs, thanks to an upgrade to the ESP-IDF framework to version 5.3.2. The developers note that support for ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, and ESP32-P4 is still being refined, and some components may not yet be fully compatible with these chips, but additional component updates are planned for ESPHome 2025.7.0 next month. That still means that ESPHome devices can connect to Thread networks and communicate with Home Assistant through the Native API as long as you have an OpenThread border router and Thread is enabled in Home Assistant. Users should note some limitations to Thread support: ESPHome does not yet support the Thread “Sleepy End Device” mode Not recommended for applications requiring high-frequency sensor data transmission Best suited for simple control and monitoring use cases Other changes to ESPHome 2025.6.0 [...]</p>

<p>AAEON UP TWL and UP TWLS are two new credit card-sized single board computers (SBCs) based on the Intel Twin Lake processor family and operating in a wide -20°C to 70°C temperature range. Both models feature a Gigabit Ethernet port, three USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, and an HDMI video output. The UP TWL SBC also comes with a 40-pin GPIO header, and the processor is underneath the board. The UP TWLS board has a thinner design once cooling is taken into account, similar to the UP 710S released late last year, with the processor positioned on top of the PCB, wafers for GPIOs and RS232/RS422/RS485, and an M.2 socket for WiFi. UP TWL specifications Twin Lake SoC (one or the other) Intel Processor N150 quad-core processor @ up to 3.6 GHz (Turbo) with 6MB cache, 24EU Intel UHD graphics @ 1.0 GHz; TDP: 6W Intel Processor N250 quad-core processor [...]</p>

<p>Back in 2022, we first saw STMicro launch the VL53L5CP ToF presence detection sensor for the PC market with features like user detection, gesture recognition, and intruder alert. Building upon that, the company has recently released its 5th‑generation Human Presence Detection (HPD) solution, built around the VL53L8CP 8×8 multizone Time‑of‑Flight sensor family with edge AI features offered as a turnkey solution for laptops, PCs, monitors, and accessories. We have seen and even tested earlier ToF sensors like the VL53L0X and VL53L1X, which used a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) for single-zone ranging. After that, we saw ST release the VL53L5, which was a major upgrade with up to 64-zone multi-zone support, enabling features like touch-to-focus and object tracking. Now, in the age of AI, ST has launched a 5th-gen turnkey HPD solution built around the VL53L8CP sensor.

<p>GEEKOM Mini IT12 2025 Edition is a mini PC with three 12th Gen Intel Alder Lake CPU options: Core i5-12450H, Core i7-1280P, and Core i9-12900HK. It supports up to 64GB of RAM, up to 2TB NVMe SSD, offers various ports such as HDMI 2.0, USB4, and 2.5GbE, and comes with WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity. GEEKOM sent us a review sample of the Mini IT12 with an Intel Core i7-1280P processor, 32GB DDR4, and a 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD. If the name sounds familiar, it&#8217;s because we previously reviewed the Mini IT12 with an Intel Core i7-12650H in December 2023/January 2024 with the same name but a different processor, and a few other changes, as we&#8217;ll see below.

            <p>Any time I show power consumption graphs for the SBCs, computers, and servers I test, I get a number of comments asking for more details about the setup.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It's quite simple, really: using my <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/yellow/">Home Assistant Yellow</a>'s built-in Zigbee radio, I connect a number of <a href="https://amzn.to/45oROls">ThirdReality Zigbee Smart Outlets</a> to it, and then I use <a href="https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card">ApexCharts Cards</a> to add graphs of power consumption over time on my Home Assistant dashboards.</p>

            <p></p>

<p>Sipeed's <a href="https://sipeed.com/nanocluster">NanoCluster</a> is a tiny compute module clusterboard with room for up to 7 tiny computers.</p>

<p>Each slot has two inline M.2 (NGFF) slots which accept either a custom-designed SoM (System on Module) or an adapter board to adapt a standard Compute Module form-factor board into the slot (as pictured above).</p>

<p>One end has a large fan for cooling, and the other end has power and IO. You can power the board via either PoE++ (60W) or through USB-C PD (65W). Or <em>both</em>, with redundant power fail-over.</p>

<p>NIST just <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/04/new-atomic-fountain-clock-joins-elite-group-keeps-world-time">put NIST-F4 online</a>, accurate to within 2.2e-16 ppm (that's <code>0.00000000000000022</code> seconds.

            <p>I've been deep into time and timing lately (more shenanigans coming tomorrow), but today I posted a video covering the install of a <a href="https://www.pctel.com/antenna-product/timing-antenna-with-integrated-lightning-protection/">PCTEL GPS/GNSS antenna</a> at my studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I put up the antenna after realizing how indoor GPS reception is just never that great, due to a variety of factors (like multipath propagation and interference), even if I placed my antennas up in the plenum space right under the roof. Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p>
