<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p></div>

<p>Libre Computer has just announced the general availability of EtherealOS for the company&#8217;s Amlogic SBCs, namely AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato), AML-S805X-AC (La Frite), AML-S905X-CC-V2 ( Sweet Potato), AML-S905D3-CC (Solitude), and AML-A311D-CC (Alta). EtherealOS is described as a lightweight internet-booted operating system designed for performing tasks such as file and disk manipulation, operating system deployment, light browser tasks, and more. It includes a limited set of tools compared to a full operating system, and it&#8217;s basically an OS to install other operating systems directly from the Internet, in a way similar to Khadas OOWOW or Radxa ROOBI OS.

<p>TerraMaster has sent me the D1 SSD Plus portable SSD enclosure for review, and helped me get a 2TB WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe SSD for testing, since the PCIe Gen4 x4 storage device reached up 7,300 MB/s to sequential read speeds, and 6,600 MB/s sequential write speeds, well beyond the 40Gbps capabilities of the enclosure. I had reviewed two ORICO NVMe enclosures previously, namely the ORICO COM2-T3 and ORICO M234C3-U4, which were both based on an Intel JH7440 Thunderbolt 3 chip. I tested the COM2-T3 up to 3166.71 MB/s with a fast SSD, but TerraMaster claims up to 3,853MB/s sequential read speed and 3,707 MB/s sequential write speed with a 4TB Samsung 990 PRO SSD, while connected to an Apple M4 Pro Mac mini (MacOS version 15.3.2) using AJA System Test software. So I thought it might be a good idea to give it a try. TerraMaster D1 SSD Plus unboxing [...]</p>

<p>LWMalloc is an ultra-lightweight dynamic memory allocator designed for embedded systems that is said to outperform ptmalloc used in Glibc, achieving up to 53% faster execution time and 23% lower memory usage. Malloc can cause memory fragmentation on embedded systems, potentially leading to crashes after the firmware runs long enough. Garbage collection is one technique for lowering fragmentation, but it&#8217;s not always practical on resource-constrained devices, and some simply avoid using malloc in their firmware, preferring static memory allocation or memory pools to improve reliability. Custom dynamic memory allocators are another option, and that&#8217;s what LWMalloc provides. LWMalloc is described in a paper entitled &#8220;LWMalloc: A Lightweight Dynamic Memory Allocator for Resource-Constrained Environments&#8221; as follows: LWMalloc incorporates a lightweight data structure, a deferred coalescing (DC) policy, and dedicated small chunk pools to optimize memory allocation. The lightweight data structure minimizes metadata overhead, ensuring a compact and efficient implementation. The DC [...]</p>

<p>AAEON MIX-MTLD1 is an industrial Mini-ITX motherboard supporting out-of-band (OOB) management and powered by an Intel Core Ultra Meteor Lake H/U processor (Intel Core Ultra 5 125H by default). The board supports up to 96 GB of DDR5-5600 memory, PCIe Gen 5 expansion, dual LAN, and various I/O options, including seven USB and four COM headers, and has a design fairly similar to the Jetway MTX-ARH1 released last week, with an Intel Core Ultra 5 125H or Core Ultra 7 155H SoC. What makes the MIX-MTLD1 different is the NCSI header for out-of-band (OOB) management using a MOD-RMB module, which links the Ethernet controller to a BMC for remote monitoring and control independently of the OS running on the CPU. This feature is common in servers, but more rare in industrial Mini-ITX boards, although we previously covered the DFI RPS101/RPS103 mini-ITX motherboards and HoneyComb Ryzen V3000 motherboard featuring OOB management [...]</p>

<p>Today, we’ll do a quick review of the new SONOFF CAM-PT2 indoor camera, which is the third model after the Slim Gen2 (CAM S2) fixed-angle camera and the Slim camera, both of which we reviewed previously. The CAM-PT2 (CAM Pan-Tilt 2) supports Pan/Tilt/Zoom functions. Its main features are quite similar to the CAM S2, including 1080p resolution, Motion Detection/AI Human Detection, and Privacy Zone support. In addition to Pan/Tilt, it adds new features such as the ability to set Preset Points to remember specific camera positions. It’s also the first SONOFF camera to support ONVIF, on top of RTSP, which has been available since the CAM S2. Let’s take a closer look at the details.

<p>MNT Reform has launched a crowdfunding campaign for the RCORE V2 module powered by a Rockchip RK3588 SoC coupled with up to 32GB RAM, and a 256GB eMMC flash for the company&#8217;s open-source hardware laptops, be it the original MNT Reform or the MNT Reform Pocket. It appears to me that it&#8217;s the same module as found in the MNT Reform Next 12.5-inch laptop scheduled to ship by the end of December, but it&#8217;s sold separately as an upgrade kit for users of previous models of MNT Reform laptops. The company explains that the RCORE V2 brings a third M.2 slot for fast PCIe-based Wi-Fi cards (with USB Bluetooth), and it&#8217;s easier to install since it works without an internal HDMI adapter.

<p>The LILYGO T-Circle-S3 is a circular touch display development board built around the ESP32-S3 MCU and designed for smart gadgets, IoT devices, and wearable applications. The board integrates Wi-Fi 4, Bluetooth 5.0, a MEMS microphone, a 3W Class-D audio amplifier with speaker support, an RGB LED, six rear GPIO pins, a Qwiic interface, and USB-C for charging. The board is very similar to the Waveshare RP2350-LCD-1.28, with its round display design, but it does not support wireless connectivity and audio. It also resembles SB Components’ Dual Roundy (ESP32-S3),  but compared to that, the T-Circle-S3 is smaller and features a touch display, a microphone, a speaker amplifier, and an RGB LED.

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>A few years ago, I admit it was rare to find someone running Arm hardware more powerful than a Raspberry Pi in a homelab (or more serious) setting, outside of cloud providers running Ampere or custom Arm CPUs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/radxa-penta-sata-hat-pi-5.jpeg" width="700" height="394" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;b178d706-e6dc-430c-8e68-b1bf0c32df52&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Radxa Penta SATA HAT on Pi 5"></p>

<p>But as Pis and Rockchip boards have become more powerful (and efficient), and Apple's M-series silicon has become more interesting (the M4 mini being an excellent value proposition for a quiet, tiny server), and even Ampere Altra pricing coming down a bit since it's an 'old' server CPU now, still offering 64 or 128 lanes of PCIe Gen 4... I don't think I'm weird in suggesting Arm is a viable platform for reliable, even powerful servers.</p>

<p>Even for storage.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Continuing the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/tags/retro">retro computer series</a>, I've recently completed the <em>first</em> part of a restoration of my Aunt's old Macintosh Classic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/macintosh-classic-on-desk.jpeg" width="700" height="467" class="insert-image" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-72ec0edd-bedd-4eb3-ba56-75e7509ea20a" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;72ec0edd-bedd-4eb3-ba56-75e7509ea20a&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Macintosh Classic on desk"></p>

<p>This Classic was handed to me alongside my Uncle Mark's Apple II, which I'll probably cover later (we've played a game of whack-a-mole with issues on that machine! Well worth it but I haven't hit a point where enough things are working to cover it well, heh).</p>

<p>The Classic is a strange Mac—it was <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_classic/specs/mac_classic.html">introduced in 1990</a> as a budget version of the 1986 Macintosh Plus, with a 68000 CPU in an era when the 68030 was the new hotness.</p></div>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I forgot to bring my portable Pi media server running Jellyfin on a family trip, but had a small selection of my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2022/how-i-rip-dvds-and-blu-rays-my-mac-2022-edition">ripped movie and TV show library</a> on my portable SSD.</p>

<p>One dreaded part of choosing a movie or show to watch after a rainy afternoon and all other avenues of entertainment are exhausted is having the kids (especially the youngest, who can't read yet) choose a movie without the 'movie shelf' showing the movie posters/cover artwork.</p>

<p>So... without the Pi, and only armed with my MacBook Air, I thought I'd spin up a Jellyfin Docker container. Except, <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/#installation-instructions">macOS is explicitly called out as unsupported for the Docker container for Jellyfin</a>.</p>

<p>Switching tracks, I found Jellyfin is also packed up as a .app for macOS, and you can install it by <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/macos/">downloading the .dmg and copying the .app to your Mac</a>, or you can do it like I did, with Homebrew:</p></div>

<pre><code># To remove an arg: `--remove-args`
# Calculation: `([size in GB] * 1024 * 1024) / 4.096`
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.pages_limit=27648000'
sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args='amdttm.page_pool_size=27648000'
sudo reboot
</code></pre>

<p>The old way, <code>amdgpu.gttsize</code>, will throw the following warning in the kernel log:</p>

<pre><code>[    4.232151] amdgpu 0000:c1:00.0: amdgpu: [drm] Configuring gttsize via module parameter is deprecated, please use ttm.pages_limit

<p>After configuring the kernel parameters and rebooting, verify the AMD GPU driver is seeing the increased memory allocation:</p></div>
