<p>Axelera Metis Computer Board is a Rockchip RK3588 mini-ITX motherboard equipped with a Metis AIPU (AI Processing Unit) capable of delivering up to 214 TOPS, 16GB LPDDR4 memory for the CPU, and 4GB LPDDR4x RAM for the AI accelerator. I first came across the Axelera Metis AIPU in M.2 and PCIe card in 2023, and I was rather impressed with the advertised 214 TOPS of AI performance promised in this form factor and relatively affordable $149 price tag considering the price-to-performance ratio. At the time, it was still hard to source the chip and module due to limited quantities, and in 2024, it became easier to evaluate the solution with the Axelera Metis PCIe Arm AI evaluation kit based on a Fireﬂy ITX-3588J mini-ITX motherboard equipped with a 214 TOPS Metis AIPU PCIe card. The new Metis Compute Board is similar, but in a more compact form factor since the [...]</p>

<p>Cervoz M.2 MEC-LAN-2001-SFP and MEC-LAN-2002-SFP are M.2 SFP Ethernet expansion modules delivering gigabit Ethernet speed over long distances for robotics using an Intel i210-IS controller compliant with IEEE 802.3x and 802.3z standards. Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP/SFP+) cages are usually associated with high-speed Ethernet connections of over 10 Gbps, but another advantage of SFP cages over RJ45 jacks is that they allow for data transmission over several kilometers, while RJ45 Ethernet is typically limited to about 100 meters. The Cervoz M.2 SFP Ethernet expansion modules would allow laying out long cables in logistics centers, smart factories, transportation hubs, and energy management facilities where Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate across long distances.

<p>WIZnet W6300-EVB-Pico2 is a development board that combines a Raspberry Pi RP2350 MCU with the company&#8217;s new W6300 QSPI Ethernet controller capable of 80+ Mbps data rates. WIZNet has made several 10/100Mbps Ethernet controllers over the years that connect to microcontrollers via SPI, but the speed is often limited to 15 to 70 Mbps due to a low SPI clock frequency and small buffers. The WIZNet W6300 Ethernet controller can deliver higher speed thanks to a 150MHz system clock, a QSPI interface with four data lines, 64KB SRAM, and 4KB TX/RX buffer for each of the 8 sockets. W6300 QSPI Ethernet controller W6300 features and specifications: Host Interface &#8211; High-speed QSPI (MODE 0/3), system bus with 2 address signals &#38; 8-bit data Internal 32KB SRAM for Tx/ Rx buffers (64KB in total) 8x independent sockets with 64KB Memory 10BaseT / 10BaseTe / 100BaseTX Ethernet PHY Integrated Auto negotiation (Full and [...]</p>

<p>Broadcast Positioning System (BPS) is an alternative to GPS designed for timing and positioning over ATSC 3.0 digital TV signals, and mainly designed as a backup solution for national security. GPS is critical in providing not only location data, but also timing data for critical infrastructure such as power grid, telecommunication networks, and so on. However, GPS signals can be spoofed, and/or satellites could potentially be damaged or even taken down. That&#8217;s where BPS comes in as an alternative with a much broader network of base stations, and both GPS and BPS signals can be compared, meaning it can be used to detect spoofing as well. It works by adding a preamble with timing data and a Data PLP (Physical Layer Pipe) with tower information and location. One tower is enough for timing data, and positioning will also be possible with four towers within range. Time accuracy is 100ns (95% [...]</p>

<p>There are plenty of small ESP32-C3 IoT boards with a USB-C connector on the market, and while they all look very similar, antenna designs differ, and less thought-out ones may severely impact the WiFi and Bluetooth range. Peter Neufeld decided to hack one of those cheap ESP32-C3 boards by adding a custom antenna, and this resulted in the board having more than twice the range and almost three times in some cases. Those tiny boards are cramped, so there&#8217;s very little space around the ceramic antenna typically used, leading to poor RF performance. To work around that issue, Peter added a 31mm long antenna made of silver-plated wire, making a loop of about 8mm in diameter outside of the board and soldered on the ceramic antenna&#8217;s solder joints, and the rest of the wire (about 15mm) points upwards. As you can see from the photo above, he didn&#8217;t remove the [...]</p>

<p>Most people have heard about quantum computers, but quantum sensors? I&#8217;ve just come across those as Bosch is developing magnetic-field quantum sensors harnessing &#8220;the power of quantum physics to enable measurements with unmatched precision&#8221; while being much more compact than other quantum sensors using techniques like SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference device), vapor cells, or optical traps. Bosch Quantum Sensing (that&#8217;s the full company name) further explains its magnetic-field quantum sensors surpass the capabilities of conventional sensors by offering a wider measurement range, higher sensitivity, and higher spatial resolution. They currently have an internal quantum sensor prototype/evaluation board that&#8217;s about the size of a smartphone, so they are still quite larger than traditional sensors. Bosch quantum magnetometer can measure tiny magnetic field variations with accuracy, including the Earth magnetic&#8217;s field, and even analyze the direction of and magnetude of magnetic fields giving the equivalent of a 3D-point magnetic representation. This notably [...]</p>

<p>Aerium System&#8217;s Lumen is a carrier board for NVIDIA Jetson SO-DIMM modules designed specifically for drones and robots with a range of low-profile connectors for I/Os for USB, UART, I2C, etc&#8230;, and three M.2 sockets for storage and wireless expansion. It targets the same applications as ARK Electronics&#8217; NDAA-compliant Jetson Orin Nano/NX carrier board for drones we covered last year, but it&#8217;s not sold as a full kit and lacks NDAA-compliance. On the positive side, it is quite smaller and lighter, so it might be better suited to smaller and/or less complex drones or robots that may still benefit from Vision AI acceleration.

<p>STMicroelectronics STM32MP23 is a dual-core Cortex-A35 general-purpose microprocessor (MPU) with a Cortex-M33 real-time core, and 600 GOPS of performance operating at up to 125°C and designed for industrial and Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge computing, advanced HMI, and machine-learning (ML) applications. It follows the STM32MP25 series unveiled in 2023 and launched the following year as the first member of the STM32MP2 family. The STM32MP23 is a cost-down version of the STM32MP25 with similar specifications (and pin-to-pin compatible packages), but the new family has a weaker 0.6 TOPS NPU, and tops at two Ethernet ports for the high-end parts instead of three. Ditto for CAN Bus interfaces (2x vs 3x). Other changes include a 16-bit memory interface and the lack of PCIe and USB 3.0 interfaces.

<p>Defined by the Shenzhen 8K UHD Video Industry Cooperation Alliance (SUCA), GPMI (General Purpose Media Interface) is an alternative to HDMI and DisplayPort supporting up to 192 Gbps bandwidth and 480W power delivery (PD). As far as I know, the specifications have not been made public just yet, but ITHome.com shared some photos and details. The GPMI standard defines two types of connectors: Type-B and Type-C (USB-C) with support for 192 Gbps/480W PD and 96 Gbps/240W PD, respectively. Here&#8217;s how GPMI compares to the latest HDMI and DP versions. The best resource I&#8217;ve found about the GPMI standard is a white paper shared by Hisilicon. It requires email registration, and it&#8217;s only in Chinese, but I&#8217;ve translated some of the slides for reference. The Type-B port looks like a compressed HDMI port, which might be great for laptops and tablets, while the Type-C port appears to be identical to a [...]</p>

<p>Twotrees has sent us a TTC6050 CNC router for review, along with a vacuum cleaner Monster (M1) kit and an 800W spindle upgrade with a speed of 30,000 RPM. The machine is designed for carving and milling various materials such as wood, plastic, and metal. It features a working area of 600 x 500 x 100 mm and comes equipped with a 500W spindle by default, upgradable to an 800W spindle. It&#8217;s capable of handling larger workpieces, works faster, and supports a broader variety of materials than the TwoTrees TTC 450 CNC router we reviewed in 2023 with a 500W spindle. In this review, we will start by listing the specifications and going through an unboxing, before assembling the TTC6050 CNC router and the vacuum cleaner Monster (M1) Kit, and installing the Candle CNC software to conduct milling tests on thick MDF wood. After that, we&#8217;ll install the 800W high-speed [...]</p>

<p>Beacon EmbeddedWorks&#8217; W5+ SoM is an ultra-compact (27&#215;15 mm) system-on-module powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon W5+ platform for wearables with a quad-core Cortex-A53 processor, a co-processor with an Arm Cortex-M55 core and an Ethos U55 ML accelerator, and WiFi 4 and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. The Snapdragon W5/W5+ wearables platforms were introduced in the summer of 2022, but so far, all I could find was a $2,000 devkit (TurboX W5+) suitable for ODM/OEM manufacturers. The upcoming Beacon W5+ SoM will be one of the first hardware solutions based on the Snapdragon W5+ platform designed for commercial applications. Beacon W5+ specifications: Platform &#8211; Snapragon W5+ SW5100P-0 SoC CPU &#8211; Quad-core Cortex-A53 processor @ up to 1.7 GHz GPU &#8211; Qualcomm Adreno A702 @ up to 1,010 MHz with OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.0, OpenCL 2.0 API support DSP &#8211; Dual Qualcomm Hexagon DSP V66K ISP &#8211; Dual ISP VPU 1080p30 Video Decode [...]</p>

<p>IFTTT and Zapier automation tools enable users to create automated workflows connecting various apps, services, and devices. They are relatively easy to use, but their free tiers are now rather limited, and you have to rely on the cloud. Huginn is a self-hosted, open-source alternative to IFTTT or Zapier that can work on your own network without cloud connectivity. Andrew Cantino released the first version of the project 12 years ago (in 2013) by Andrew Cantino, but it now has a larger community of developers and users. Somehow, I only found out about Huginn when XDA Developers wrote about it earlier this week. Let&#8217;s have a look. Developers describe Huginn as a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you online, and view it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier hosted on the user&#8217;s server with full control over the data. Here are some of the [...]</p>
