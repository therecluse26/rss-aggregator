<p>Revopoint Trackit is a high-end optical 3D scanner that achieves accurate object tracking for small to large workpieces without needing markers on the object&#8217;s surface. This significantly increases scanning efficiency over conventional marker-based 3D scanning systems. The 3D scanner features an optical tracking system ensuring smooth scanning despite complex shapes, angle changes, or position shifts, maintaining stable data acquisition. The scanner offers two scanning modes with a 30-line cross blue laser mode for quick scans and a single-line blue laser mode for capturing narrow, hard-to-reach areas. Both laser modes can deal with dark and shiny surfaces without the need to first apply scanning spray, making it great for capturing delicate workpieces like circuit boards. Other highlights include a wide operating range suitable for small to large pieces (think coins to cars), auto gimbal calibration, and the ability to operate the device as a standalone handheld scanner (with markers).

<p>Radxa ROCK 4D is yet another Rockchip RK3576 SBC, but offered in a credit card form factor similar to the Raspberry Pi 3 model with the usual 40-pin GPIO header, Gigabit Ethernet ports, and four USB ports. We first noticed it when we covered the Radxa Dual 2.5G Router HAT, and I&#8217;ve just seen it added to the Linux 6.15 release, so I thought it might be a good time to cover it, especially since it&#8217;s already for sale on Allnet and AliExpress starting at $31 plus shipping. Radxa ROCK 4D specifications: SoC – Rockchip RK3576 or RK3576J (industrial-grade version) CPU – Octa-core  CPU with 4x Cortex-A72 cores at 2.2 GHz, 4x Cortex-A53 cores at 2.0 GHz GPU – Arm Mali-G52 MC3 GPU with support for OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, and 3.2, OpenCL 2.0, and Vulkan 1.2 NPU – 6 TOPS (INT8) AI accelerator with support for INT4, INT8, INT16, [...]</p>

<p>STMicroelectronics has introduced the LSM6DSV320X, a compact AI-enabled inertial measurement unit (IMU) that integrates a 3-axis digital gyroscope, a 3-axis low-g accelerometer (±16g), and a 3-axis high-g accelerometer (±320g) in a tiny 3 x 2.5mm package, ideal for space-constrained IoT devices such as wearables, smartphones, gaming controllers, smart tags, personal safety gear, and industrial monitoring systems. Most motion sensors are designed to track daily activities or detect sudden impacts, but the LSM6DSV320X is built to do both. One accelerometer tracks everyday motion up to ±16g, while the other handles high-impact events up to ±320g. One of the most interesting features is its adaptive self-configuration (ASC), which allows real-time adjustment of internal settings based on activity without the need for a host CPU, optimizing power use and responsiveness. It also includes a machine learning core (MLC) capable of running up to eight decision trees and a finite state machine (FSM) to [...]</p>

<p>The UV Meter is a Flipper Zero application designed to measure ultraviolet (UV) radiation using the AS7331 spectral sensor, which can detect UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C wavelengths. Designed for personal and environmental UV monitoring, this tool measures UV exposure levels in everyday scenarios, whether it&#8217;s behind windows, under cloud cover, or while wearing sunglasses. It provides real-time irradiance readings in µW/cm², W/m², or mW/m², and calculates safe maximum daily exposure durations based on 2024 TLVs and BEIs from ACGIH, with adjustable factors like eye protection status, gain, and exposure time. A visual meter and warning symbols notify the user of under- or overexposure. The app also displays each UV type’s relative contribution to overall exposure risk. A compact adapter PCB enables easy connection between the Flipper Zero and the AS7331 breakout board via I²C.

<p>Linus Torvalds has just announced the release of Linux 6.15: So this was delayed by a couple of hours because of a last-minute bug report resulting in one new feature being disabled at the eleventh hour, but 6.15 is out there now. Apart from that final scramble, things looked pretty normal last week. Various random small fixes all over, with drivers as usual accounting for most of it. But we&#8217;ve got some bcachefs fixes, some core networking, and some mm fixes in there too. Nothing looks particularly scary. And this obviously means that the merge window opens tomorrow as usual, and I see the usual people being proactive and having sent me their pull requests. It&#8217;s memorial day tomorrow here in the US, but like the USPS, &#8220;neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night&#8221; &#8211; nor memorial day &#8211; stops the merge window.

<p>Infineon PSoC 4100T Plus is a new low-power Arm Cortex-M0+ MCU designed for battery-powered or low-power embedded systems that require advanced capacitive touch and proximity sensing. The microcontroller comes with 128 KB of flash, 32 KB of SRAM, and an 8 KB ROM. One of the most interesting features of this MCU is Infineon’s fifth-generation CapSense MSCLP technology, which enables high-resolution, low-power capacitive sensing even in deep sleep mode (as low as 8 µA). Its capacitive sensing uses both self and mutual capacitance methods, supported by analog front-end filtering, sigma-delta modulation, and digital filtering techniques, delivering a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 5:1 for accurate detection. The MCU supports gesture detection, human-machine interfaces (HMI), and smart sensing applications, making it ideal for wearables, consumer devices, and IoT systems. Additional features include a 12-bit 1-MSps SAR ADC, six TCPWM blocks, smart I/O with programmable logic functions, multiple UART/I2C/SPI interfaces, and up to [...]</p>

<p>Huawei Matebook Pro (HAD-W24 / HAD-W32) resembles a typical laptop with a 14.2-inch display, 24GB to 32GB RAM, and 1TB or 2TB SSD storage. What&#8217;s less common is that the processor is not named, and the laptop is the first to run Huawei&#8217;s HarmonyOS operating system. Those two are due to Western countries&#8217; sanctions against the Chinese company. Huawei used to sell Intel-based laptops with Windows and Android smartphones, but they&#8217;ve not made hardware based on US technology for a while. As software support would eventually run out, they had to work on an alternative named HarmonyOS, which has been used on smartwatches, smartphones, and tablets for a while, but the Matebook Pro is the first computer sold with the new OS. While we don&#8217;t know the processor used, reports mention the Kirin X90 10-core (4+4+2) / 20-thread Arm SoC as an &#8220;Apple Silicon&#8221; solution.
