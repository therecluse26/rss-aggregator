<p>ANAVI Miracle Emitter is an open-source hardware ESP32-C3 WiFi and BLE controller designed to control 5V addressable RGB LED strips, which works with Home Assistant over MQTT and also supports the popular WLED firmware to easily control the LED strip through a web interface. It also features four I2C expansion headers for sensors and a small OLED display, a UART header, and a GPIO header. It&#8217;s an update to Leon ANAVI&#8217;s Miracle Controller introduced in 2019 with an ESP8266. A lot of things have changed since then, and it&#8217;s gotten easier than ever to control RGB LED strips using open-source software and firmware.

<p>Waveshare has recently launched RP2350-CAN, a Raspberry Pi RP2350-powered CAN development board with onboard XL2515 CAN Bus controller and a SIT65HVD230 CAN transceiver. The board supports the CAN V2.0B protocol at up to 1 Mbps, and the XL2515 chip appears to be a clone of the popular Microchip MCP2515 CAN controller. The board includes the same 26 multi-function GPIO pins and USB-C port as found on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2. Other features include a DC-DC buck-boost converter (MP28164), BOOT and RESET buttons, a user LED, a selectable 120Ω CAN termination resistor, and CAN screw terminals. The CAN Bus board targets automotive, industrial control, and robotics applications. Waveshare RP2350 CAN specifications: SoC – Raspberry Pi RP2350A CPU Dual-core Arm Cortex-M33 @ 150 MHz with Arm Trustzone, Secure boot OR Dual-core RISC-V Hazard3 @ 150 MHz Up to two cores can be used in any combination Memory – 520 KB on-chip SRAM [...]</p>

<p>AAEON&#8217;s COM-MTHC6 COM Express Type 6 module is powered by the Intel Meteor Lake H processor series with a choice between the Core Ultra 9 185H, Core Ultra 7 155H, or Core Ultra 5 125H CPUs. The module supports up to 96GB DDR5 memory, features an optional BGA SSD, two MIPI CSI connectors, and two standard 220-pin B2B connectors exposing interfaces such as PEG 4.0 and PCIe Gen4, and offers a 9V to 16V power input range. AAEON claims the COM-MTHC6 is the world’s first COM Express Type 6 equipped with a 45W Meteor Lake-H CPU, such as the Core Ultra 9 185H.

<p>Openviro Axe PoE is a rack-mountable, open-source environmental sensor designed to measure the temperature and humidity (and air pressure) in server rooms or cabinets with electrical equipment. The device is based on a Raspberry Pi RP2040 board with Ethernet connectivity housed in an aluminum enclosure and equipped with two RJ12 connectors for Bosch BME280 sensors with an accuracy of +/- 0.5°C. It provides better results than sensors placed in a machine that may be impacted by the internal components&#8217; heat dissipation. For instance, the two sensor inputs can be used to measure the temperature and humidity of the intake and exhaust in a server rack.

The mesh network relies on nodes to communicate with each other and relay messages to other nodes if needed. However, this does not work reliably when nodes are too far apart or one node goes offline for whatever reason. That&#8217;s when Meshtastic repeaters are needed.

<p>Cervoz M.2 MEC-LAN-2001-SFP and MEC-LAN-2002-SFP are M.2 SFP Ethernet expansion modules delivering gigabit Ethernet speed over long distances for robotics using an Intel i210-IS controller compliant with IEEE 802.3x and 802.3z standards. Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP/SFP+) cages are usually associated with high-speed Ethernet connections of over 10 Gbps, but another advantage of SFP cages over RJ45 jacks is that they allow for data transmission over several kilometers, while RJ45 Ethernet is typically limited to about 100 meters. The Cervoz M.2 SFP Ethernet expansion modules would allow laying out long cables in logistics centers, smart factories, transportation hubs, and energy management facilities where Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate across long distances. Cervoz M.2 MEC-LAN-2001-SFP and MEC-LAN-2002-SFP specifications: Ethernet 1x or 2x Gigabit Ethernet connectors via Intel i210-IS controller(s) Support Wake-on-LAN and Hot-Swap function 1x or 2x SFP cages via MEC daughter board Host interface &#8211; M.2 B+M Key edge connector with [...]</p>

<p>WIZnet W6300-EVB-Pico2 is a development board that combines a Raspberry Pi RP2350 MCU with the company&#8217;s new W6300 QSPI Ethernet controller capable of 80+ Mbps data rates. WIZNet has made several 10/100Mbps Ethernet controllers over the years that connect to microcontrollers via SPI, but the speed is often limited to 15 to 70 Mbps due to a low SPI clock frequency and small buffers. The WIZNet W6300 Ethernet controller can deliver higher speed thanks to a 150MHz system clock, a QSPI interface with four data lines, 64KB SRAM, and 4KB TX/RX buffer for each of the 8 sockets. W6300 QSPI Ethernet controller W6300 features and specifications: Host Interface &#8211; High-speed QSPI (MODE 0/3), system bus with 2 address signals &#38; 8-bit data Internal 32KB SRAM for Tx/ Rx buffers (64KB in total) 8x independent sockets with 64KB Memory 10BaseT / 10BaseTe / 100BaseTX Ethernet PHY Integrated Auto negotiation (Full and [...]</p>

<p>Broadcast Positioning System (BPS) is an alternative to GPS designed for timing and positioning over ATSC 3.0 digital TV signals, and mainly designed as a backup solution for national security. GPS is critical in providing not only location data, but also timing data for critical infrastructure such as power grid, telecommunication networks, and so on. However, GPS signals can be spoofed, and/or satellites could potentially be damaged or even taken down. That&#8217;s where BPS comes in as an alternative with a much broader network of base stations, and both GPS and BPS signals can be compared, meaning it can be used to detect spoofing as well. It works by adding a preamble with timing data and a Data PLP (Physical Layer Pipe) with tower information and location. One tower is enough for timing data, and positioning will also be possible with four towers within range. Time accuracy is 100ns (95% [...]</p>

<p>The Topaz Tz170b FPGA devkit from Efinix is a compact FPGA evaluation platform built around the Efinix Tz170 FPGA. This FPGA is built around a low-power, high-density 16 nm Quantum fabric and comes in a compact 484-ball FineLine BGA package. The company mentions that the board supports hardware-level MIPI D-PHY with data rates of up to 2 Gbps per lane and hardware-level LPDDR4 memory controller, making it ideal for high-speed embedded systems, vision processing, and custom SoC designs. Additionally, it includes 256 Mbit of LPDDR4 memory, dual SPI NOR flash memories, and high-speed QSE connectors for Efinix or custom daughter cards. Expansion is further enabled by a low-pin-count FMC connector, a microSD slot, user LEDs, and push buttons. Clock options include 33.33, 50, and 74.25 MHz oscillators, and a full range of onboard regulated power sources for stable operations. These features make this device useful for applications like edge AI, [...]</p>

<p>The Mono Gateway is a nano-ITX router board powered by an NXP LayerScape LS1046A quad-core processor and equipped with two 10GbE SFP+ cages, three gigabit Ethernet RJ45 ports, and M.2 sockets for wireless WiFi 6 and/or tri-band WiFi 5, Bluetooth, and Thread modules. Tomaž Zaman&#8217;s YouTube channel description reads &#8220;I hate routers&#8221;, and that&#8217;s exactly why the &#8220;Gateway&#8221; came to life. He wanted a router that meets his expectations and runs open-source software. The NXP Layerscape LS1046A was selected thanks to its ability to support 10 Gbps Ethernet with up to 26 Gbps line-rate throughput for VLANs, PPPoE, and NAT. Let&#8217;s have a look.

<p>EDATEC ED-PLC2010 is an industrial controller powered by a Raspberry Pi CM4, supporting EtherCAT and Modbus interfaces, up to 32 I/O modules, and preloaded with CODESYS runtime for real-time core and visualization capabilities. DIN Rain-mountable Raspberry Pi CM4 industrial controllers are not exactly new, with products such as Modberry 500 CM4 and Edgebox-RPI4 announced shortly after the launch of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 in 2020. More recently (2024), Seeed Studio introduced the reComputer R1113-10 IoT gateway, and Sfera Labs launched the Strato Pi Max. TECHBASE also upgraded the Modberry 500 with a more powerful CM5 module. EDATEC ED-PL2010 mostly differentiates itself by shipping with a licensed version of CODESYS runtime for industrial automation. It&#8217;s also possible with other vendors, but the license might need to be purchased separatly.
